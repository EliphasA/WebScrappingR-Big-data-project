"Lovely Namibia","I stayed in this hotel many years ago, when it was called the Kalahari Sands Hotel, the building is the same but a very clean, modern, internal transformation has taken place. Big rooms with lovely comfy beds and refreshing bathrooms. Windhoek has changed dramatically, for the better, since my last visit in 2009. I still remembered the lovely food, wines, beers and friendly people. The hotel is a mixture of business and big tourist parties, who check in for the night and disappear next morning on their game drives. I only ate breakfast in The Pantry and it was very good, served by extremly friendly, happy staff who always looked after my every needs. My thanks go to Ruth and Jakobina, the housekeepers who kept my room spotless, Ananias my breakfast waiter, and Ronald the poolbar waiter who made a very good Dom Pedro. I watched the South African rugby first match with a fellow supporter and on my last night he wished me safe journey, he was the Sales and Marketing Manager, no air and graces, just a person doing a very good job leading his team. Once again thank you all for a lovely stay and will be seeing you soon.","Date of stay: September 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Restaurant rooftop- worst service","Restaurant review:The food is fine, but don’t go there and expect to get any service. They let me and my friend wait over 𝐓𝐖𝐎 𝐇𝐎𝐔𝐑𝐒 for our food. And we were stupid enough to come back (because my friend lives just across the street and there is nothing else around here). This time they told us 10minutes and we waited an hour again!! So disrespectful to people’s time.It’s the worst service and they waiters couldn’t care less. The worst part is they didn’t even give us a discount or a proper excuse. Even the door man looked like he didn’t care about anything in the whole world.

"Thanks Jacqueline and Kylie","I don't write reviews but I would be doing a disservice if I didn't. We stayed 12 days at Avani, it was amazing. The part that made our trip memorable was the love, care and attention we received from Kylie and Jacqueline at the pantry.

I will recommend my friends and family to visit Avani because it was more than just a place to stay. Jacqueline and Kylie made us feel at home. They took such great strides to take care of us and other guest. They also educated us on the community and the culture. They have su h beautiful hearts .

"Fabulous experience!!","Our time and experience here was my favorite in Windhoek.  Miguel,our server, was the best server I’ve had in Namibia and he went above and beyond to take care of our group. I had the filet and risotto which was top notch! View and atmosphere was superb! I will definitely be back to share with others.","Date of stay: October 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Komfortabel aber unpersönlich","Das Hotel liegt mitten im Zentrum, alles ist zu Fuß zu erreichen, Sehenswürdigkeiten, Geschäfte, Restaurants. Dabei sollte man jedoch nicht vergessen, dass samstags ab ca. 14.00 Uhr in Windhoek alles geschlossen ist. Im Restaurant des Hotesls kostet das Abendessen (Büffet) den Festpreis von ca. € 19, sonntags ab ca. € 22. Ungewöhnlich ist, dass die Rezeption im 4. Stock eines Einkaufszentrums liegt und nicht von der Straße aus zu erreichen ist. Praktisch ist der kostenlose Parkplatz im angrenzenden Parkhaus, vom dem aus man direkt ins Hotel gelangt.Unser Zimmer (Nr. 1109) war sehr groß, sehr gut eingerichtet, schönes Bad, Safe, großer Schrank,,, alles vorhanden und sehr sauber.Der Pool auf der Dachterrasse ist absolut unattraktiv, zu klein, unansehnlich.Das Frühstück war wirklich ausgezeichnet, sehr reichhaltig und gut.Zu bemängeln haben wir die totale Anonymität des Hotels, das Personal an der Rezeption, in der Bar, im Restaurant ist unfreundlich, wenig hilfsbereit, sehr umständlich.

"Une étape parfaite au départ ou à l’arrivée à Windhoek","Nous avons séjourné 1 nuit à notre arrivée à Windhoek. Chambre parfaite, insonorisation, climatisation, 2 lits super confortables très appréciés après une nuit en vol depuis Paris et une journée de transfert depuis JNB. Le top fut le petit déjeuner buffet succulent le lendemain (inclus dans prix si vous passez par centrale de réservation -comme nous-, moins cher que le prix d’une guesthouse). Standard européen-américain mais ne cherchez pas le charme. Wifi payant assez bon débit mais pas cher. Par contre, un seul bémol la réception a très peu de carte d’accès aux chambres ! Un gardien nous a accompagné jusqu’à notre chambre et sommes restés sans carte. Suis descendu à la réception une heure plus tard et ai récupéré une carte. Nous avons pu sortir diner sans problème. Hôtel central, situé dans centre commercial, banque dans le hall, parking sous hôtel mais quartier visiblement « chaud » la nuit avec dames très peu vêtues derrière l’hôtel.","Date of stay: July 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A double room in Namibia is a twin room- 2 single beds in UK !","A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE AT KALAHARI SANDS HOTEL!!!I booked my hotel online at octopustravel.co.uk. A very good site to get good deals on good hotels. I left UK@8pm on a flight to Windhoek in Namibia. I did not have a direct flight so I had to change in J.B. I did not get to the hotel until 3 pm the next day after 15-17 hours journey. I was very very tired! I had a copy of my confirmation of my hotel room (a double room) and my ref no with me.I presented my copy to the receptionist of the hotel expecting to get my key and walk to my room (that was my desperate wish- I was falling asleep while talking). 2 hours later I was still at the reception explaining that I have booked a double room, expecting to get a double bed not a twin room with 2 single beds. When I booked online my room, I was given the option of; a twin room, meaning to me 2 single beds or a double room expecting a double bed. I have booked a double room so I can sleep next to my husband not miles away on a single bed!!!I had no choice other than to use my mob to call the travel agent in UK to explain my problem. A very nice lady from the Customer service in UK- octopus travel.co.uk , she was a really big help to me-  helping me to get my double bed I have booked online ( sorry I don’t know her name ,I would like to say a big thank you for her appreciated help ).  She also agreed with me that I have booked a double room and I believe like myself expecting me to get a double bed. I was called back in 20 min l and I was told that I should get a double room at no extra cost and that now there is a double bed available for me, originally told a standard double bed was not available for me. With the help of this wonderful lady ,  after nearly 3 hours wait I got a room with 2 double beds at no extra cost ( I only needed one bed). The hotel receptionist told me that if I want a double bed then I will need to pay extra about 50-60 EURO per night. Thanks to Customer service in UK I did not have to pay any extra money for my double bed I originally booked online.THE HOTEL !!!NOT A 5 * HOTEL! GOOD LOCATION ONLY CLOSE TO TOWN CENTRE AND SHOPPING BUT... A VERY BUSY PLACE ! ONE OTHER NIGHT I STAYED IN A 4 * HOTEL SAFARI COURT - BIGGER ROOMS - MUCH BETTER VALUE FOR MONEY AND BETTER VIEW!!! THE BAR OF THE KALAHARI SANDS HOTEL I personally BELIEVE IS WELL KNOWN BY PROSTITUTE!!! SO IF YOU ARE SITTING WITHOUT A MAN NEXT TOU YOU - OTHERS MAY BELIEVE - YOU ARE A PROSTITUTE!!! ... HAPPEND TO ME!!! - PLEASE BELIEVE ME   ...I DONT DRESS OR LOOK LIKE ONE OF THEM! I hope my experience will help others!","Date of stay: September 2009This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Bien situé et moderne","Hôtel de conception récente et très moderne, situé en plein centre ville à proximité à pied de tous les centres d'intérêts, 14 étages avec ascenseurs (très capricieux, on attend souvent assez longtemps pour en obtenir un malgré le fait qu'il y en a trois). La chambre (la notre au 10ème étage) est de très grande surface, très grand lit king size, literie récente, salle de bain avec douche à l'italienne et baignoire, produits d'accueil, nombre de serviettes à disposition, vue magnifique sur la ville, double rideau occultant efficace, TV écran plat de grande largeur, climatisation efficace, réfrigérateur, bouteilles d'eau fournis...vraiment une très belle surprise digne d'un 3 étoiles. Question accueil vraiment efficace et souriant de même qu'au restaurant. Concernant la restauration vraiment beaucoup de choix et le petit déjeuner, je n'ai jamais vu durant tout mon cicuit de 10 jours en Namibie un tel choix, c'est incroyable le nombre de mets proposé ici: en sucré, salé, chaud, froid, fruits frais, laitage, pains, viennoiseries, boissons de toutes sortes  je ne peux tout énumérer tant il y en a et pourtant j'ai, voyagé mais ici c'est exceptionnel!!!  Wifi enfin efficace partout dans l'hôtel, vous avez aussi un casino au sous sol et surtout un accès direct au mall commercial attenant.

"Good location but the refurbishment is disruptive","Great location in the centre of town. As it’s easy to drive in Windhoek we picked up our hire car at the airport and went for the free hotel car parking option. However, with all the refurbishment work to the hotel and the multi-storey car park, it was very difficult to find the access. We ended up having to park on the road, find our way in via the shopping centre to the first floor reception to then get car park directions to their fourth floor car park as there were no signs visible for either the hotel or its car park with all the scaffolding everywhere. My husband thought the hotel was closed and nearly went elsewhere as he was so fed up driving around in circles trying to find the entrance. It’s a very busy hotel and with not all their small lifts working, it took a long time to get between the room and restaurant etc. That said we had a very nice clean room on a high floor and once the whole hotel refurbishment has completed, I’d consider using again but not during the refurbishment.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Business hotel in the heart of Windhoek","We arrived and found the hotel didn't have our reservation which was booked through Expedia.com.  We had also pre-paid the hotel as if we hadn't we would have stayed at another property. The hotel required proof we paid, proof of our booking, and took over 45 minutes to check us in.  In the meantime we went to the Sunday lunch buffet which was pricey but tasty with truly exceptional service. The room was fine, clean, modern.  Looked like it could have been in Minneapolis or Berlin.  The internet was fine.  The pool was cold.  There is no gym.The casino being on site creates a slightly seedy environment and the mall that the property is located in closes on Sunday at 1 pm. Downtown Windhoek is really nothing special so if I were to stay in Windhoek again I'd stay in the north east corner again which is a higher end neighborhood with more luxurious and quaint properties.The positive is that the property is super convenient for access to the airport.","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I stayed initially in Room 1406, then the Suite, Room 1408 on the top floor in the 14th Floor just below the Roof top where there is the Conference Centre. Both rooms had a bird's eye view of Windhoek City Centre with the Hilton Hotel and the Namibian Supreme Court Buildings just across my room.

"Layover","This was a layover between Walvis Bay to Oranjemund and my first time in Windhoek, which was great mostly due to walking into my hotel room and feeling at home. The room was very comfortable, clean. modern and showed off a view of the city. Room 1115It is about a 40 minute drive from the Windhoek Airport, situated in the City Centre, with direct access to shops within the mall. There is a roof top pool and wellness centre for the ladies (prices are above average with a large selection to choose from). There is a casino and bar lounges.Two negatives experienced were; the iron (which seemed like a toy iron) as it did not function like it is meant to and the check-in and check out process. Check in was busy with very little order between the reception staff which resulted in my colleague and I receiving incorrect room access cards, incorrect rooms were billed and hence this made check out confusing for the staff.Other than that great stay, I will be back.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Mediocre stay with a few lowlights","The hotel itself is situated in the city centre so is very convenient and surprisingly not noisy despite its location.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable[I was booked into a king size room]. Free unlimited wifi available. Breakfast is okay - selection of fruits, pastries and hot food.  The only option for dinner is a buffet - no a la carte menu available in restaurant - pretty bland dishes - unappetising roasts and overdone, oily veggies. The major lowlight was a security breach - when returning to my room after breakfast I discovered my bedroom door wide open clearly exposing my handbag and notebook which was on the bed.  As the housekeeping trolley was parked nearby I assumed that they had entered the room, discovered that I was not out and left without closing the door.  Hardly any response from management. I requested that my client book at another hotel this week because of these and many other issues.","Date of stay: August 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Bien pour une nuit","Nuit passée dans dans cet hôtel en fin de circuit en Namibie. Architecture (tour) moderne de 16 étages, sans charme particulier.Situé dans l'artère principale de windhoek ( avenue de l'indépendance) .entrée par un centre commercial .A noter , un lounge climatisé accessible par le niveau bas , sans passer par la réception.Chambres très spacieuse, modernes , climatisées.très bonne literie.Très belle salle de bain, bien équipée.Hotel très calme.Intéressant par sa situation qui permet de visiter ou se déplacer à pieds facilement.A noter : petite piscine et petite terrasse sur le roof au 16 eme étage.très agréable en fin de journée pour se détendre un peu.Dîner et petit déjeuner sous forme de buffet : Divers , variés, rien à dire.En revanche , personnel assez souriant mais assez désorganisé, malheureusement :(3 appels à la réception pour obtenir des serviettes de piscine au bout de 45 minutes...Table réservée à 15 h a la réception pour le dîner à 20h mais ... Réservation oubliée entre la réception et l'accueil restaurant (mauvaise communication ?), D'où 15 min de bataille pour solutionner et trouver une table.....Wake-up confirmé pour le lendemain a 7h du matin pour départ...mais oublié aussi ..suis descendu à 7h30 pour râler à la réception et les informer d'une nouvelle faille!Avons eu , bien sur , des excuses mais cela faisait beaucoup.Cet hôtel reste un bon compromis malgré tout.Déception : Wifi payant....un peu déplacé pour ce genre de produit !","Date of stay: February 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A good hotel to stay in passing through","A clean and tidy hotel and was a good place to spend a night on our to and from our two week Namibian trip.  We're not really into Casinos in a big way so didn't spend any time in the Casino which looked somewhat dowdy.  The restaurant was good and served good food and as others have mentioned it's conveniently located in a shopping mall.  Not much ambience but given our amazing experiences in the rest of Namibia and Southern Africa we treated it as a stopover point and it is ideal for that purpose.","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Service not acceptable","Stayed at Kalahari 3 nights in August.When I was booking the hotel I checked the reviews about it and some people complained about the service, usually I don't care about it but in this hotel is really a problem. Very very slow and disinterested, specially, desk staff. Breakfast is great, huge buffet with a good choice, but then again service is bad..it took minutes just to ask and get a cup of coffee.Location is great, very central and only few minutes walking from shoppingmalls and main attractions in WDH. Rooms are good as well and bathrooms big and modern( shower and bath separated).It could be an excellent hotel but even if you don't care about service you ll be disappointed about it.","Date of stay: August 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not quite","Check in was poor. Attendant was preoccupied and directed me to ninth floor. My room was on the 10th. Needed extra towels the following morning took almost thirty minutes for these to arrive. Almost missed my meeting. By then had called housekeeping four times. Apparently had to pay for wifi - go downstairs to business centre to get this. I should have been told as I checked in. Experience so poor decided not to even bother with breakfast following morning. Not to mention now running a little off pace due to towel wait. Am a frequent traveller to Windhoek. Previously stayed at the Hilton. Was sold the close to office bit for KS. Never again. Besides Hilton is like 100m down the road so no difference really.Back to the Hilton. For good.","Date of stay: September 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nach Renovierung wieder empfehlenswert!","Wir haben am Anfang und am Ende unserer Namibia-Rundreise im Kalahari Sands Hotel & Casino übernachtet und ich muss sagen, nach der aufwendigen Renovierung kann man das Hotel jetzt wieder weiterempfehlen.Das Hotel liegt super zentral in Windhoek direkt in der Innenstadt, verfügt über ein kostenfreies, bewachtes Parkhaus und ist mittlerweile sehr ansprechend eingerichtet und sehr sauber.Leider ist der Poolbereich noch nicht fertig renoviert und war daher nicht zu nutzen, aber wenn dieser Bereich genauso aufwendig renoviert wird, wie der Rest, lohnt sich die Wartezeit.Im Vergleich zu vor 5 Jahren, kann ich das Hotel jetzt jederzeit weiterempfehlen!Das reichhaltige Frühstücksbuffet überzeugt wie gehabt jeden.","Date of stay: October 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great Locatin","The reviews show that the Kalahari Sands has changed since I was last there. It is located right downtown in Windhoek, since I was there on business I found the location to be great. It is a bit weird walking into the hotel because it is located in a shopping mall which is not what you normally expect. There is a casino in the hotel. I really liked the Kalahari Sands, I found the rooms to be very clean and the room service was great. The breakfast at the hotel's restaurant is really vast and was VERY good. Yes this hotel is a bit pricey, but everything in Namibia is a little more expensive than the rest of Africa. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling in and out of Windhoek.","Date of stay: October 2006This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comfortable ","This property has been totally refurbished recently including the small shopping complex attached to the hotel. It is located in the heart of the city with a bigger shopping centre in walking distance.The rooms are a good size with pleasant furnishings and a comfortable bed, chairs & a big TV. My room had nice views over the city. For rooms recently refurbished there are a couple of flaws in my opinion. There are no power points next to the bed for charging electronic devices (they have to be charged from the desk opposite), & all the lights have to be on or off. No way to just have one lamp on. And why is a thick duvet required in this climate?The bathroom has a seperate shower and bath.Breakfast was included in my room rate & there was a good selection of hot & cold dishes. The restaurant on the 15th with great views all around the city is worth checking out. There is a pool on 15th as well but it’s really only a small plunge pool & more a decorative feature.There is a room with a few slot machines which is the casino part of the hotel but it’s not very obvious.Staff are generally pleasant & helpful with a few exceptions.Nothing overly special or different but a comfortable 4 star hotel.","Date of stay: April 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Pleasure","I am visiting AVANI since round about 15 years. It had always the charme of a ""good friend"" and most different to many of the so called ""modern"" hotels. Hope it will maintain this character. You can not compete, if you are not different to your competitors. You can improve service, value, a menu, wine lists, but you should always keep your character if people enjoy.  I undertstand that mass tourism brings a good profit, but  a good reputation could be even more important.","Date of stay: November 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A Very Ordinary Stay","I recently stayed at this Hotel. Situated in the heart of Windhoek, it is located in the middle of a shopping centre which is useful with a Supermarket Chemist and other shops on your door step.With regards to the Hotel itself, it is one of those situations where nothing is bad, but nothing is outstanding either.The rooms are clean and comfortable but are a few years old and could probably do with a spruce up. The bed was comfortable and bathroom was ok. I had to get them to replace a shower nozzle as water sprayed everywhere except on me.The restaurant once again was average and my biggest complaint was that you either had a bevy of waiters wanting to help you, or you battled to get service. There was no allocation of seating areas among the staff. The Buffet was very average, but nothing to rave about. There is a limited A la Carte menu which was available in the Casino restaurant, but I did not eat there.Also there is no Gym at this hotel, which is strange for this day and age.Internet access was acceptable.","Date of stay: April 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Always where we stop by for lunch ahead of an evening flight .","Having visited Windhoek regularly and needing to arrange a meet with agent or place to linger after drop off while waiting to go to the airport it has become our habit to take lunch hear. Either in the Restaurant, which is good value, or in the Oasis Bar which serves good snacks and where one can linger a while longer.Very comfortable and central.

"Great Hotel at city center ","This is definitely a gem at downtown Windhoek. It's centrally located along Independence ave which runs the length of the city with amazing shops and eatery all around it. If your looking for a home base to explore and enjoy Windhoek, this would be the place. The hotel is located within a shopping center which means everything you will ever need is at walking distance. It's upstairs with escalators provided and banking ATM all around you. Our room was a double deluxe with flat screen tv and worked fine. They use DSTV and I was able to catch up on sports games, live. The rooms are cozy and does have air conditioning. We visited in the summer so not sure about heating. The bathroom came with a tube and a one-person sized standing shower. There are signs posted to conserve water and to limit shower to 6minutes, which was plenty enough. There is a refrigerator as well with complimentary 2-bottles of hotel-brand drinking water. Breakfast starts at 6:30am and ends at 9:30am. It was thesame everyday, but it was more than the usual complimentary breakfast you would find in other hotels. This was buffet/style and has variety of food- scrambled eggs, sausage, beans, ham, fish, toast, coffee, juice drinks. We noticed no waffles or pancakes. But overall breakfast experience was good. I recommend including breakfast in you hotel deal if you can. But there are plenty of places downstairs within the shopping mall that provide excellent breakfast as well. Outside the hotel, you can easily get shuttle cars to take you wherever you need to go. But we find them expensive, can charge no less than N$60. But We walked down the block and found local taxi that took us around the city for N$10. It's N$10 flat rate for anywhere within the city limit, which was easy for us and they can't cheat you.I would recommend this hotel, it can be expensive to stay here for the casual traveler. But it's well worth it. Front desk is open 24hrs and there is wifi at the hotel. You have to ask for the guest code to use wifi. The wifi needs improvement because it drops all the time and not very strong.","Date of stay: November 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good hotel in Windhoek","Overall the hotel was clean and pleasant. The staff were helpful and facilities well managed.  We didn't use the bar but it looked comfortable and was located next to a casino for those who like to gamble. I think you should be aware of the location of the hotel.  Although I knew it was located in a mall I was imagining a Sandton City lookalike, this is not the case.  When you drove to the location of the hotel you have to go into the mall car park.  Luckily the security card told us to go to the 4th floor for the hotel.  It is a busy concrete car park with little thought to the first impressions. You have to walk past various shops (cash converters, OK furnishers etc) and around the corner you find the more upmarket entrance to the hotel.  I didn't feel unsafe it was just a very odd place for such a nice hotel, so just be aware.Our rooms were clean and comfortable.  The windows were locked and it did feel very stuffy even with the a/c on. I would recommend this hotel to couples and business travelers but maybe not so much to those with kids who plan on staying longer than a couple of nights.  Very little open places to keep kids occupied.Breakfast was good although the dining room was very busy and we had to sit at a dirty table as it was all that was available.  The staff quickly came and cleared it though so not an issue. Staff were helpful especially when we realized our 2 rooms were quite far apart they went to extra effort to find 2 rooms next to each other. The porters were also very helpful in fetching our luggage from the car park.","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The perfect hotel for a business trip","I stayed at the Avani hotel on recommendation from colleagues, having previously stayed at the Safari Inn, which was a disappointing experience.  The hotel is perfect for business travelers, as it is in the heart of the city and close to businesses and shopping centres.  The rooms have everything a business traveler needs, with excellent wi-fi.  What was mst impressive was the quality of food in their restaurant.  Breakfast was a veritable feast and the evening buffet was not your usual dreary affair, but offered stir-fry choices, fresh seafood cooked in front of you and excellent salads.  The desserts were to die for - I landed up having 3 pieces of mini cheese cake!","Date of stay: February 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Die Rezeption gibt je nach Tageszeit und Mitarbeiter gegensätzliche Aussagen bzgl. Taxikosten, Öffnungszeiten u.ä. raus.

"A nice room for a high price","The room is nice, located on top of a casino. Breakfast and fitness center access was included in the price. The breakfast was excellent, fitness centre was quite poor with very few weights for serious weight lifters. The gym was full of cardio machines so it might work for some other type of people. Room itself was luxurious and nice. Wifi is not included in the price. I bought one hour unlimited wifi access and it stopped working after 10 minutes or so. I was quite dissappointed about that.

"Avoid it if service is an issue for you","This hotel has world quality facilities, but their service and ability to respond to guest needs leaves much to be desired. At breakfast for instance, when one asks for coffee the waiter/ress proceeds to clear tables, consult other customers etc before eventually going to get the coffee about 5 - 10 minutes later. Surprisingly, room service is friendly and very efficient. The thermostat for the water seems forcefully set on barely warm, to the extent that one is freezing when coming out of the shower. I logged a complaint every day for three days before the temperature was barely acceptable and this is winter! One night, upon returning to the hotel after 10pm I found the security guard blocking the lift with a couple in it, demanding proof that the lady was a resident. Mind you, I had seen this couple in the lobby and restaurant for three days at that point. I asked if I could use the lift and he just ignored me. My fridge was also locked, apparently I needed special permission to have it unlocked, and 'therefore accepting responsibility for the minibar', and yet, I was asked 3 times by three different people if I had used anything from the minibar when checking out! How? the fridge was locked!","Date of stay: June 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A gem in the heart of the city","This is a Sun International Hotel with a casino. The hotel is in a mall complex which has a great selection of stores on the ground level.The room was luxurious and the beds and pillows were very comfortable. my only complaint would be that the noise levels when there is a party on the roof terrace filters down to the rooms (roof terrace was on the 19th floor and I was on the 9th floor). I would stay there again and its a great venue for meetings and business trips as it is central, as compared to  the Windhoek Country Club which is a fair distance out of the city centre.I see that many people complained that the staff were slow. If one appreciates that this is Namibia and service is SLOW EVERYWHERE! People are not rude and bad at service - because they feel they are giving you the best service.

"Pleasant surprise in the middle of Africa","While flying Air Namibia ( sucked ), our flight was delayed and we ended up spending the night in Windhoek.  Air Namibia put us up in this hotel.It was probably the first time during our trip when we were really pleasantly surprised by the food offered at the hotel's buffet.  Variety of European, American, and African foods.  All you can eat and delicious.The room was wonderful.  Really top notch.  Very clean and fun.  Gambling at this place was pretty uneventful and drinks at the bar were quite pricey, but all in all it was a really wonderful experience.If you happen to be in the area, spend a night at this place.  You won't regret it.","Date of stay: February 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Old and tired, but great central city location","I had a reasonable stay at this place but it is definitely getting old and tired. It’ll need a bit of work to get it up to international standards. Great central city location though, right in the thick of things, and helpful friendly staff.The first thing that I noticed upon checking in was a smoke filled lobby – not a nice reception. The place seemed really busy and noisy with not enough reception staff to handle things. The elevators were painfully slow, with long waits for an available lift. The hallways on my floor smelled old and musty and it looked like there was water damage on some of the walls and carpet. The location of the hotel is excellent, inside a mall complex in the heart of the city, directly across from the tourist info center. There is a bank right next to the hotel entrance and a big supermarket a couple of floors down – very handy – and no shortage of eateries in the immediate vicinity.The room was fairly average in most respects. It seemed clean enough but it definitely needed and little love and care. The TV was really old and the sound quality was just awful. The bathroom was fairly old and the water barely seeped out of the sink faucets. The shower was OK though, with good pressure. The internet system was a real disaster. For starters it was really expensive. Secondly, if you purchase 1 day’s worth of internet, it expires at midnight, rather than 24 hours after purchase, so if you want to use it the following morning, you have to buy another day’s worth. Also, the WiFi wasn’t working on all floors and a lot of people were complaining about this.The hotel doesn’t have a gym, but they will give you a complimentary pass to a commercial gym down the street. The buffet breakfast wasn’t too bad, with all the normal breakfast items you’d expect. The staff were always very friendly and helpful, really nice people. Check-in and check-out did seem to take a bit more time than usual though. I think they actually need to extend the reception area a bit as it was always over crowded.All up, a fairly average experience, and I think that I would look for another hotel the next time I visit Windhoek. I don’t really recommend it unless you really want to be right in the city center. I don’t think it was good value for money.","Date of stay: February 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ein Hotel ohne Risiko - und ohne afrikanisches Ambente !","Das Kalahari Sands Hotel liegt direkt im Zentrum der namibischen Hauptstadt Windhoek und entspricht den gängigen internationalen Maßstäben. Es nimmt für sich in Anspruch, z. Z. das beste Hotel in der Stadt zu sein (allerdings wird schräg gegenüber gerade ein Fünf Sterne-Luxushotel von Hilton gebaut...). Die Zimmer sind geräumig und funktional eingerichtet, könnten aber ebenso wie das Bad eine Renovierung gut gebrauchen. Empfehlenswert ist auch das im Haus befindlcihe Restaurant. Sehr viel geduld braucht man mit dem Lift; das System ist permanent überlastet. Die Preise schwanken sehr stark: Vorausbuchen lohnt sich auf jeden Fall, vor Ort muss man z. T. mehr als das Doppelte bezahlen !","Date of stay: May 2010This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"An almost perfect stay…","The location of the hotel, in the city center and next to a mall, is very convenient. Great service from the team with a special mention of the breakfast shift and Kevin at Stratos. The first two nights were excellent with food and drink orders being served on time. The third night was a complete opposite of that experience! There were several issues:i) We kept requesting for our food and drinks more than 3 times before we were servedii) Some of the food served was over salted iii) They forgot one order (gourmet burger), which took over 30 minutes to prepare once we asked about it iv) Desserts were served while we were still eating the main course v) Some people received their desserts before others had even been served their main coursesThis last day’s dinner experience ruined an otherwise excellent stay!","Date of stay: October 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Stratos","Shanice - Exceptional Service and Warm HospitalityI had the pleasure of dining at Stratos at Avani rooftop bar and restaurant recently, and I must commend our waitress, Shanice, for her outstanding service. From the moment I was seated, she made me feel welcome with her warm smile and friendly demeanor. Her attention to detail was impeccable—she anticipated our needs before we even had to ask and was always nearby without being intrusive.Not only was Shanice knowledgeable about the menu, but she also provided excellent recommendations that made my dining experience even more enjoyable. She handled all requests with grace and efficiency, even during the busy rush, ensuring that my meal was seamless from start to finish.It's rare to encounter such a dedicated and professional waitress, and Shanice truly made the visit memorable. I highly recommend dining here and hope to be served by her again on my next visit. Thank you, Shanice and I look forward to seeing you again next year!","Date of stay: September 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Die angrenztende Parkgarge welche überwacht und gratis ist, konnten wir durch einen Durchgang ins Hotel erreichen. im unterene Stock ist ein Supermarkt wo wir unseren Wasserstock und Esswaren einkaufen konnten. Die Zimmer waren sehr schön und frisch renoviert. Ein Scheribtisch mit Stuhl sowie ein Polsterstuhl, sowei das Badezimmer mit Duschkabine waren sehr schön. Die Betten waren die bequemsten unserer Namibiareise. Von unserem Zimmer hatten wir eine prächtige Aussicht auf die nahen berge und Bahnhof. Das Frühstücksbüffet war vielfälltig und sehr gut. Das Personal könnte jedoch noch freundlicher und hilfsbereiter sein, wobei dies der einizige negativ Punkt war. Die Toplage um die Stadt zu erkunden war für uns massgebend und das Hotel ist gerade darum sehr zu empfehlen.Wir würden wieder dieses Hotel wählen.","Date of stay: June 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not Great","stayed for 3 nights for a business trip. Was appalled by the prostitution activities occurring blatantly in the street in front of the hotel and in the hotel bar area. One evening my colleague and I were propositioned by a very obviously high/drunk man - offers of marriage and a place to sleep. The bar staff did take very quick action and the security staff removed the intruder. Still a very disturbing experience. Breakfast was very average although service was good. The hotel is located in a shopping centre so you have to walk through the centre with your luggage, very unpleasant. Room service took forever. Rooms ok.","Date of stay: February 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Modern and clean","We stayed here and the first impression was very good. The rooms are spacious and neat. Modern finishes, great decor. I will stay there again. There are however 3 things i didn't like. 1- there was a guy who asked me for money in the lift. I am 5 ft, he was 6,2ft, no contest, i gave him n$ 100. I reported it to security and they said they knew of him, he is a local taxi driver. Didn't help me feeling safer. 2- their bar and restaurant is very bad, no sock, no service. I will DEFIniTELY not use their restaurant again. 3- location: although it is close to a big shopping centre, garages and main roads, the hotel is in a remote are, surrounded by building development development, so it makes it a bit lonely isolated and with no view other than construction works.","Date of stay: December 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Excellente localisation","Le Kalahari Sands n'est certainement pas un hotel de charme mais le meilleur choix pour un sejour d'une nuit apres ou avant un vol international.Il est en plein centre ville, l'entrée située dans une galerie commerciale dont la plupart des magasins ouvrent a 8h du matin.  Des banques et distributeurs de billets juste a coté de la réception.  Les attractions touristiques accessibles a pied.Quant a l'hotel, il s'agit d'un hotel 'international' donc des chambres 'standards' mais spacieuses ayant toutes les facilités de ce genre d'hotel. Le petit dejeuner avec show cooking et le soir buffet servant des plats internationaux mais aussi des plats nationaux.  Ce n'est pas de la gastronomie mais c'est correct.  Le service a la reception est correct, nous sommes en Afrique, il ne faut pas etre pressé...Le principal atout de cet hotel est sa situation.","Date of stay: November 2008This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great hotel in good location.","Really nice hotel especially after 2 flights from London. The room was very spacious (I think we got a free upgrade). Lovely bathroom and they had a mixture of international sockets to recharge ahead of our tour - a bonus!The breakfast was really good...a great choice of cereals, juices, fruit, smoothies, pastries, hot food,  eggs made to order. (ate too much)Would highly recommend, good location. There is also an open market across the road to get your african souvenirs. The hotel is accessed  from the first floor of a mall that has a supermarket, bank and other shops. The shops tend to close from around 1pm on Saturdays and i don't think opened on Sunday. There is a large supermarket and shopping mall about a 5min walk from the hotel though. There really is not much to see in Windhoek so only use as a stop off for your tour! Oh there is also a v small pool located on the roof.Would recommend getting a taxi (about 10mins) to Joe's beer house for dinner & drinks, chilled out with random decor.The hotel was in the process of being upgraded while we were there but should be finished by now.","Date of stay: September 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The rooms are larger than the average business hotel which gives one a sense of space.

"Hotel with good amenities (which are not its own)","If you are staying in Windhoek on business I would suggest this is the best place. Situated in the heart of the city this hotel offers all what a business traveler wants- close access to restaurants, shops & offices, transport, parks etc. Also, if you are the one who likes to do a bit of shopping then the hotel is situated to handicraft emporiums, local clothing stores, jewelry stores and so much more. And to keep you entertained, the hotel has a casino to keep you busy all through the night.The staff at Kalahari are experienced and I found them better than that at Hilton. But one word of advise is that if you are a foreign national then i would suggest that you get your booking confirmed in writing to avoid any misunderstanding.","Date of stay: September 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A great place to stay","Kalahari Sands Hotel is smack-bang in the centre of Windhoek, so everything is within easy reach. The hop-on bus departs straight in front of the hotel, at the tourist kiosk. There is a great park accross the street from the hotel, great for a lazy afternoon stroll or just sit there and check out the city life. I've found a great German restaurant about a block from the hotel, worth a visit! Ask concierce to make reservations. Hotel itself has got spacious rooms, and is very neat. Pool on the roof a bit 'impersonal' was my experience. Great breakfast, though! Will definately return!","Date of stay: September 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ok hotel in the city center","I have stayed at this hotel for 1 night recently and have to say that it really was ok.Check-in at the reception was quick, the lifts worked properly all the time and the room was average and clean. If you ask for room on a high floor is will be quiet and you will have a nice view of the city.This hotel does not offer luxury, but ok quality for the price and the location is hard to beat as it is situated right on the main road in the city center. There is also a small mall (including a bank plus ATM) in the same building and it was easy and safe to walk on the streets nearby for shopping and eating at a really good restaurant called ""Gathemanns"" (only a 5 min. walk, 1 st floor).On top of the hotel there is also a small open air pool area with some chairs which was nice to relax.For me it was a perfect choice for staying in Windhoek for 1 night before leaving for Sossusvlei!","Date of stay: December 2007This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Wir haben 2 zimmer für 2 nächte gebucht, welche nicht einmal einen balkon haben nachdem das unfähige personal uns 3 mal einen anderen preis offeriert hat.Nichts desto trotz, das zimmer hält/hotel hält nicht im geringsten einen 4stern standart.Doch das beste kommt erst. Nachdem wir über 1000.- im hauseigenen „casino“ wenn man das überhaupt casino oder eher freakshow nennen darf, da scheinbar jeder da reingelassen wird und alles eher provisorisch, statt professionell ist, wollten wir um 3:00 noch ein bier trinken. Da wurde uns gesagt, sorry es ist nicht mehr möglich……….Obwohl uns gesagt wurde das „casino“ hat bis um 4:00 geöffnet wurden wir um 3:30 rausgeschmissen und mehr als 10 Angestellte standen blöd rum und behaupteten das es unmöglich wäre noch ein bier aus dem hahnen zu lassen!!!!Nach mehr als einer halben stunde zu diskutieren bot ein angestellter an für uns an die Tankstelle zu laufen um bier zu hohlen, obwohl wir noch neben dem bierhanen standen. Ich gab ihm also geld und nach weiteren 15 min kam er zurück und sagte, sorry die tankstelle ist geschlossen aber behalte das geld und bringt uns am nächsten tag bier!!!!!Ich denke mehr muss ich dazu nicht sagen.

In fact the reception, the treatment, the meals and much more is simply of a class beyond every expectation. The presence of the staff at all the times makes costumers movements in the hotel's vicinity. Thank you AVANI Hotel and casino.","Date of stay: November 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Thanks but no thanks","This hotel is under construction and nothing is mentioned on the website. Swimming pool and gym are not available but they still charge you the same price.Lifts are a nightmare to navigate as there is no guide and you can only operate them from outside. There are *, -1 and 0 with no indication of where these take you. Parking is a horror experience. You get a ticket at the (very difficult to find entrance)  and if you forget to validate it, you have to drive 4 floors up, take the lift down ( if you know which button to press), go back up and navigate through a construction site, to go 4 floors down to street exit. They were welding at the entrance from parking area and we had to ask them to stop as sparks were flying. At night the street at the back of the hotel was lined up with “ ladies of the night”. Staff are friendly. Rooms are comfortable.Not recommended.","Date of stay: October 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Average Stay","Stayed at hotel for business purposes and location was very convenient. Rooms are large and offers most amenities we looked for. WiFi is good but they do insist you provide personal details and then except that it may be used for marketing - found that a bit sneaky. Breakfast offered was good but nothing special. Hotel currently under renovations so expect some inconvenience. I do think there are other hotels to consider in area, maybe this would be better after renovations.","Date of stay: September 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Could be amazing, but not there yet","One can understand how important it is for the hotel to continue with its upgrade efforts, but it does unfortunately get in the way of a comfortable hotel experience. It also doesn't help that the other service elements in the hotel don't work as well as they should. As other reviewers have indicated, it takes an absolute age to get a lift (only 2 in operation, with small capacity), and one has to occasionally share the lift with someone from housekeeping with massive bags of linen laundry or armfuls of towels because they don't seem to have a service lift. In my two days there, I had to build in 'travel' time in the hotel because I never knew how long it would take to get to my room on the 11th floor. My first room was inaccessible due to an issue with the locking system so I was moved to another room and to their credit, they upgraded me due to the inconvenience caused. The room was lovely and spacious, with a comfortable bed, couch, large bathroom, and tea/coffee facilities. My upgraded room was clearly meant for the serious business traveler as it included a printer, Bluetooth speaker, and a Nespresso machine. The problem is that if they failed to replenish your coffee station, it takes 3 attempts of requesting an item before it eventually arrives.The hotel's main restaurant offers breakfast and a dinner buffet. The breakfasts were enjoyable with many options available. The buffet dinner was somewhat disappointing, and rather expensive too. On my second night, I opted to eat in the Pantry, the bar/light meals space in the hotel foyer and the food was miles better than the restaurant! I would definitely have eaten all of my meals there if I knew any better.With the hotel undergoing major renovations, there is the issue of drilling and construction noises during the day, sometimes into the early evening. I can see that the hotel is hoping to improve its offer and its customer experience but the service levels leave something to be desired. The staff at reception were very professional and friendly, but the restaurant staff are the opposite. They are not particularly friendly or service oriented. My overall experience of the hotel is one of extremes. Things either work, or they don't . The hotel is next to a small mall and it includes a supermarket on the lower floor, as well as some clothing and touristy shops.You need a bit of patience to stay at the Avani in its current state, but overall an average business trip experience.","Date of stay: June 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Brief stay at the Avani","I enjoyed my stay at the Avani. The room was great. The food in the restaurant was good, especially the seafood. Although the hotel was being renovated, it was not too noticeable except that some lifts were out of service. What was somewhat frustrating, was that the escalator to the hotel entrance was not working one way. It made entry to and from the hotel, whcih is situated in a shopping mall, difficult.","Date of stay: December 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hotel céntrico y elegante con habitaciones amplias y cómodas","Nos alojamos una noche para una visita rápida a Windhoek. Se trata de una hotel grande, con salas de conferencias y espacios para eventos. Nuestra habitación -la estándar- era espaciosa, con dos camas grandes y muy cómodas y con un lavabo equipado con ducha y bañera. El wifi era de calidad. Pagamos unos 105 € con el desayuno incluido. La ubicación excelente, en pleno centro de la ciudad. El desayuno era tipo bufet, con variedad y producto de calidad. Desconozco si dispone de aparcamiento porqué cuando nos alojamos ya habíamos devuelto el coche. Dispone de una pequeña piscina en la azotea.

"Retour à la civilisation","Le retour à la civilisation est brutal quand vous arrivé dans cet hôtel. L'hôtel est trés bruyant dans ses parties communes (restaurant, bar, accueil et surtout casino). La restauration est très bonne et variée mais très mal organisée. Les chambres sont spacieuses et confortables. Attention les ascenseurs peuvent être capricieux. La situation géographique de l'hôtel est idéale, en plein centre ville. Hélas l'hôtel manque de charme. Il est placé dans une galerie marchande très glauque le soir.","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ottimo hotel","Abbiamo scelto questo hotel per la posizione centrale e la presenza di un (piccolo) centro commerciale. All'arrivo le signore della reception sono state molto gentili, in pochi minuti siamo stati registrati e abbiamo raggiunto la Camera,  spaziosa e pulita. Una volta entrati c'è una piccola anticamera, a destra l'armadio, davanti la porta del bagno e a destra un salottino con tavolino e due poltrone, una scrivania con bollitore e ovviamente il letto. Anche il bagno è grande e pulito, con un bel box doccia a destra, vasca davanti e lavandino sulla sinistra. Dalla nostra camera la connessione Internet era ottima, al momento del check in vi daranno la password da inserire nel vostro dispositivo. Abbiamo consumato in albergo anche la cena, dopo 24 ore di viaggio non avevamo nessuna voglia di uscire, e forse questa è la parte da migliorare. Si tratta di un piccolo buffet, anche con prodotti di qualità ma costoso (il pranzo Costa circa 140 dollari namibiani, la cena, chissà perché 245). Comunque quando abbiamo mangiato noi cucinavano al momento del pesce e degli spaghetti di soia (da abbinare con verdure varie, carne, pollo o pesce). Oltre a questo c'era della carne, pollo ai ferri e contorni. Pochissima frutta, purtroppo, e qualche dolce/gelato. Una sorpresa il caffè espresso, discreto e con un costo più basso che in Italia. Birra sempre più conveniente dell'acqua. Per quanto riguarda la colazione, invece molto meglio: buona scelta di frutta, brioche, pane tostato e non, marmellate e ... nutella! Ovviamente, per chi gradisce, anche salumi vari, uova e formaggio. Se avete necessità di una sim card locale, potete andare al supermercato ubicato esternamente, basta fare una rampa di scale, magari anche per prendere acqua (7 dollari a bottiglietta) o qualcos'altro, e acquistarne una per telefonare in Italia e avete anche internet disponibile: costo 7 dollari, ma fate subito una ricarica di almeno 150. Volendo, prima dell'ingresso dell'hotel c'è anche una banca per cambiare gli euro (attenzione agli orari, noi siamo arrivati quando era già chiusa). Insomma, io l'Avani lo consiglierei di sicuro!","Date of stay: August 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Recent name change and difficult to find but excellent hotel","This hotel used to be known  as the Kalahari Sands and on the GPS and google maps it is still like that and not AVANI. Further more, you can spot the hotel from a few blocks away, but due to the fact that it is located in a shopping mall makes it difficult to find. Drive into the parking at the mall, drive all the way up to level 4 and then enter the mall at the stairs, and look across the mall where you will see the hotel entrance. Once inside, this is an awesome hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful. It was hot and we would have loved a welcoming drink or wet towel, but no luck. We had a lovely room a bath and a shower and large bed. Some of the staff make a point of remembering guests' names and are very helpful. The hotel provide parking tickets in order for guests to park for free. In the breakfast room, Richard started to talk to my husband and they were like old friends each morning, Richard calling my husband on his name and remembering how he likes his coffee. O and each morning, returning from  breakfast, we found our room already cleaned and made up and fresh for the day - awesome. One night we went to the Oasis bar as it was very hot. We decided to have fish and chips with our beer and could not believe our eyes and taste buds! The food was presented beautifully on a very large plate and every thing, that is the salad, chips and fish were excellent. If not for the issues with finding the hotel and the lack of a welcome drink, I would have given AVANI Windhoek 5 stars. Will try to go back.","Date of stay: September 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hotel with bad smells from bathroom.","This is a good business hotel, centre of town, good restaurant, big rooms and mostly good staff. Enjoyed my stay of 3 nights but got irritated with the 3x elevators, the only way to get to my room on the 7th floor. The management should ban the staff from using the elevators during peak hours, they move from one floor to the other, certainly they can use the stairs. Waited for 10 minutes at times. Going to the bar is useless, rather use outside cafe's etc. The service is bad, I think the bar man's name was Kenneth, I managed to get one drink and then waited for 20 mins and left without second drink.  The plumbing need attention, I had bad smells from the bathroom and had to complain twice before they attended to the problem but the disgusting smell just came back on the last day.

"hotel internazionale in centro","anche se difficile da individuare se non sei accompagnato, in quanto è all'interno di un centro commerciale e per di più al 2° piano, è comunque il classico albergo internazionale di un paese meta di turismo di gruppo. le stanze e i servizi sono assai spaziosi, pulizia e organizzazione all'altezza delle stelle, prima colazione notevole per assortimento.tutto perfetto quanto anonimo e spersonalizzato, ma questa non vuole essere una nota negativa, è solo il denominatore comune di questo tipo di alberghi. lo consiglierei comunque ad un amico.","Date of stay: November 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"comodo e pulito!!!!!","E' stata la mia ultima notte in Namibia. albergo comodo nel centro della città.(anche se il centro della capitale non regala grandi attrazioni)Camere pulite e molto spaziose, piscina al piano superiore discreta ma acqua gelida. buono anche il servizio bar ristorante testato sia per cena che per colazione. Il casino alla sera regala qualche emozione in più nel senso che è pieno di gente matta.Parcheggio comodo.Ci tornerei!!!!","Date of stay: February 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"viel zu überteuert, aber zentral","Hotel im 1. stock eines Einkaufszentrum, Parkmöglichkeiten sind vorhanden. Empfang und Lobby sehr repräsentativ, allerdings mangelt es an Freundlichkeit des Personals. Nur widerwillig werden Fragen beantwortet und ""Gast ist König"" war definitiv nicht die Einstellung des Personals. Zimmer sind abgewohnt aber geräumig. Badezimmer hätte ich keinem 4-Sterne-Hotel zugeordnet. Ausserdem wurde gerade umgebaut, von früh bis spät nachmittags war es höllisch laut, sodass man sich im zimmer nur schreiend unterhalten konnte - vorgewarnt wurden wir nicht, entschuldigt hat sich auch keiner (sind ja schließlich doch immense preise die man zahlt für ein 4-sterne hotel). Neuankömmlinge nach einem langen Flug haben es da schwer Ruhe zu finden. + Lage- Freundlichkeit- Komfort","Date of stay: January 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"sehr alt  und  ekelhafte Zimmer","Musst beruflich nach Windhoek und die Hotelauswahl ist sehr begrenzt. Das Kalahari Sands Hotel gehört zu den drei 4 Sterne Häusern der Stadt. So ein altes und abgewohntes Zimmer habe ich lange nicht mehr gesehen. Das Bad war eine Zumutung (wurde seit dem Bau in den 50er Jahren nicht mehr renoviert). Preise sind absolut überzogen für das Haus. Gott sei Dank eröffnet Ende des Monates ein HILTON gegenüber. Die Lage ist nämlich gut, direkt in einem Shopping Center und zu Fuß ist einiges zu erreichen. Personal ist leider auch sehr unfreundlich !","Date of stay: April 2010This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Old Darling needing a facelift (or two)","I have stayed at Kalahari Sands twice. Both times, the lifts have not been working properly resulting in long waiting times - which can be as long as 15 minutes.The property is undergoing some sort of refurbishment, which caused some noise during the day. Otherwise, the hotel is very quiet and peaceful.The rooms I have stayed in were quite spacious and decent. Nothing fancy, but a solid slightly worn ***-gear. Bathroom was clean, but again not from the latest collections.The front office staff was very kind and efficient. They even knew that the wireless network is not strong in the room allocated for me and asked if I wanted another.As some earlier reviews discounted the dinner buffet, I decided to try it. It was not actually so bad, but neither was it something special. I think it will not be difficult to find better alternatives. The lobby bar serves some light meals, which are better value for money. The staff at the bar is slightly uninterested, but they are an exemption from the rest. The bar houses also some local entrepreneurs, which may make it inconvenient for other ladies or those with children.There also is a small roof-top pool and a couple of sun chairs. It usually is a nice and quiet place, if you somehow manage to get up there… the same dysfunctional lifts referred to earlier should take you here. In the interest of time, I took the stairs.The location of the hotel is very good. There are many nice restaurants just around the corner. The area, and especially Independence Avenue, usually is safe during daylight, however the streets behind the hotel may not be.","Date of stay: March 2008This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Excellent service! 👍👍👍👍👍","My family stayed at Hotel Avani Windhoek for 5 days. All the hotel staff were very friendly and welcomed us. From receptionists, bellboy, housekeeping and service staff.The breakfast buffet offered a wide variety of fresh fruits, pastries, and hot dishes that catered to every taste. I particularly enjoyed the made-to-order omelet station, where the chef prepared my omelet exactly to my liking. Oh ya, my sons love the salmon and waffles! 😋The staff at the Dunes restaurant were incredibly attentive and courteous. Our server, Michelle ensure we had everything we needed and made excellent recommendations from the menu! Thanks for your kind assist.The ambiance in the dining area was elegant and relaxing, with soft music playing in the background. The tables were always clean and well-presented, which added to the overall dining experience.Thanks Avani Windhoek Hotel!","Date of stay: July 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The food was all fresh and served promptly. Best for us was our server Olga. She was delightful and made sure we enjoyed everything.

Food is even better.Not the cheapest but that shouldn't hold u from enjoying amazing views and even a cheeky dip in the pool from this great casino hotel that is setup to entertain and feel lush.5 out of 5 or 10 out of 10What are you waiting for?

"Worth it if you don't get embroiled with reservation","The breakfast crew was amazing! Many thanks to the whole team, who tried to satisfy our requests.The room management staff were also great in providing the best comfort.Lunch/dinner at the pantry was yummy, albeit we had to wait some time to get served.The reception personnel was a mix...some very capable and efficient staff on one side while some terribly hopeless people on the other hand. And i prefer not to mention the mediocre back office.Some of the staff go out of their way to make sure you are enjoying your stay at the Avani. They truly are dedicated. All our thanks go to Zigo, Sascha, Moses, Helvi, Katrina, Laula, Ti-a and Kavemunu and their colleagues. Near the hotel a lil shopping area. Other shopping outlets within walking distance. Also near are the craft markets and landmarks, including the church.Nice view from upper rooms and from 15th floor bar. Enjoy beautiful sunrise and sunset.

"Gehobenes Hotel?","Wir mussten uns die Zeit in Windhoek totschlagen, da unser Flug am Abend ging. Windhoek selbst ist meiner Meinung nach keinen Besuch wert. Alles ist lärmig, lauter Baustellen, keine wirklich ansprechende City, die einlädt zum Verweilen. Also sind wir zu einem kleinen Snack in das Avani Hotel gegangen. Erst einmal ansprechend und freundliche Sevicekräfte begrüßen uns. Nach einer Weile stellen wir fest, dass wir zwar die Karte bekommen haben, niemand kommt aber wieder, um unsere Bestellung aufzunehmen. Währenddessen stellen wir auch fest, dass wir immer mehr anziehen, da die Klimaanlage auf sehr kalt gestellt ist. Sehr unangenehm. Mir ist es immer ein Rätsel, wie Leute in diesen vollklimatisierten Räumen ohne Schaden zu nehmen, aushalten. Wir sind in Afrika und gedulden uns, unsere Bestellung wird von der sehr freundlichen Bedienung schließlich aufgenommen. Bis das Essen kommt, dauert es ebenfalls recht lange. Was mir sehr negativ in diesem Hotel aufgefallen ist, ist der Zustand der Hoteltoilette im Foyerbereich.

"Sehr gutes Hotel, aber der Zugang ist schrecklich","Das Hotel liegt in guter Lage an der Independence Ave im Zentrum, das man von dort aus fußläufig erkunden kann. Sollte man mit dem Taxi ankommen, muss man durch eine viel besuchte Einkaufspassage, mit der Rolltreppe in den ersten Stock, an Bankautomaten vorbei zum Eingang des Hotels. Gleich gegenüber der Rezeption befindet sich das Casino - lauter Spielautomatenlärm dringt ins Foyer, Spielsüchtige - vor allem ältere Frauen - stehen Schlange. Wir empfinden diesen Eingang einfach schrecklich.   Mit dem Leihwagen ankommend fährt man auf der Rückseite des Hotels in das Parkhaus bis in den 4. Stock. Dort sind Parkplätze für Hotelgäste reserviert, der Zugang aber genauso schrecklich. Der Zugangsbereich zu Lift und Zimmern wird nochmals durch Personal abgesichert.Unser Zimmer war groß, sehr sauber und entsprach nach der überfälligen Renovierung nun wieder einem 4-Sterne Niveau. Wir hatten im 9. Stock einen schönen Blick über Windhoek.Das Fruehstueck ist sehr reichhaltig, wurde immer frisch aufgefüllt und so hatten wir täglich einen hervorragenden Start in den Tag. Das Preis- /Leistungsverhältnis ist in Ordnung, wenn das Frühstück im Zimmerpreis eingeschlossen ist. WLAN ist vorhanden, jedoch kostenpflichtig. Im Zimmer angekommen fühlten wir uns sehr wohl.","Date of stay: January 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Kalahari Sands Hotel is back on track","Some time ago i was very sad about the Kalahari Sands after having stayed there with a group of clients last February.  I wrote a rather negative review about the service and the elevators and some other stuff.  Today I am happy to tell you that i think the hotel is back on the good track.  I stayed at the Kalahari Sands for three nights this month and i noticed the change for better.  The first good news is that the three elevators are now working and that is a considerable improvement!  Service in the Dunes restaurant during breakfast is unbelievably better.  There's more people to help the clients, coffee is almost immediately served as you sit down, tables are reset much faster than before.  It is in fact a lot better!","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"ON REFERME LA PARENTHESE  NAMIBIENNE","Et voilà, le rêve se termine, il nous faut rentrer chez nous et reprendre l'avion mais avant nous passons une dernière nuit sur le sol Africain dans cet immense hôtel ou nous nous sentons un peu perdu . La chambre est immense et la salle de bains luxueuse, toutes sortes de produits sont mis à notre disposition, bain moussant , shampooing, peigne, charlotte, necessaire de rasage pour les hommes. Petit bémol, impossible d'accèder à la salle de restaurant, nous sommes vendredi , fin de semaine et la fête bat son plein avec un chanteur dans la salle de restauration : résultat, une cacophonie sans nom, on ne s'entend même pas parler. Nous nous empressons de prendre un plateau repas et l'emportons dans notre chambre. Par contre le lendemain matin après avoir chercher vainement le sèche cheveux, caché dans un tiroir du bureau, nous nous sommes tapé un excellent petit déjeuner avant d'affronter 15 heures de vol.

"Incorrect","L'hôtel, où nous avons séjourné le samedi 21 octobre, est en complète transformation, à commencer par les 4 ou 5 étages de parking. Un avis posé dans la chambre fait état des très gros désagréments que cela provoque mais aucune information lors de la réservation. Comme je l'ai indiqué à la réception, c'est lors du booking qu'il faut le préciser afin de pouvoir chercher un autre endroit. Impossible de dormir, les marteaux piqueurs ont sévi le samedi jusqu'à 23h et, surtout, le dimanche matin dès 5h !!. Entre deux, déménagement, coup de marteau et autres bruits sourds nous ont valu une belle nuit blanche. Cerise sur le gâteau: il y a 3 ascenseurs dans l'hôtel mais 2 étaient en panne. Et comme tout le monde part en même temps, pas besoin de préciser le temps d'attente des bagages le dimanche matin.... Pour terminer sur une meilleure note, le buffet du repas du soir est très bon.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice hotel terrible food ","We stayed at this hotel as an overnight stop on the way to kobo kobo Hills. The hotel is situated in a small shopping centre. We stayed in a superior room on the 3rd floor facing the road. The room is a nice size and the bathroom is sufficient with a separate bath and shower. The airconditioner in the room works very well. The dinner at the hotel restaurant was a buffet which we weren't to keen on so we ordered fillet steak from room service. Both steaks arrived ice cold and were as tough as leather (I would be very surprised if it was fillet). We then decided to give room service another try by ordering apple pie served hot with vanilla pod ice cream and cream anglaise. What arrived was ice cold tasteless apple pie from the fridge decorated with whipped cream from a can on top of it. The vanilla pod ice cream on the side was a tasteless scoop of bright blue ice cream. We didn't bother to eat any of it after one bite. Okay hotel but I would make other eating arrangements if you stay here.","Date of stay: January 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Awful Room Service","I am at Avani hotel now, checking out on Saturday the 10th. I just experienced the worst treatment with their room service. While am busy working in my room I decided to order dinner with the room service. First there was no response after calling for more than 4 times, when I enquired at the reception they were happy to assist by taking my order-- I should have known better. Then I waited for more than an hour, of course I didn't notice the time flying by coz I was busy. When I decided to check, coz I was now desperately hungry, the room service hadn't received my order and the reception simply dismissed it as a misunderstanding in the kitchen. Am going to bed very hungry, very angry coz it's rather too late to order anything else risking another hour's wait.It's a shame that incompetences and sheer laziness of the staff should overshadow what would've be an excellent stays the hotel. A four star hotel could do better in monitoring their standards. I doubt whether they care at all. This has left a very bad taste in my mouth, literally.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Dort hat er auf uns gewartet und uns einen Parkplatz zugeteilt. Anschliessend half er u ns mit dem Gepaeck vor die Hotelempfangshalle die eben in diesem 4ten Stock ist.Das Zimmer was sauber und gross. Wundervolles Badezimmer mit einem Brausekopf, der sich von Regendusche bis hartem Wasserstrahl einstellen liess.

Nothing like free slow internet.The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Pity the entrance to the hotel is through a mall which is not appealing at all.

"Namibia - Windhoek","This is  a great hotel if you are doing business in central Windhoek as you could probably walk just about anywhere you needed to be in the city centre. Its not far from Klein WIndhoek and is accessible from all the main routes in and out of town. Although the hotel has apparently been refurbished, it could do with a good clean and polish but its a comfortable stay with all the things you need if there on business. It does have WiFi but you have to buy the airtime which I think is ridiculous in today's time with connectivity being a pre-requisite on any business trip. The staff are friendly but the service isn't that great - I had to wait over two hours for my room service meal to eventually be delivered. Management are not that visible and although when I did find someone of authority I was promised that this cold meal would not appear on my bill, this wasn't the case.Not bad overall but they need to pull their socks up if they want to stay competitive.","Date of stay: July 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"OK for business travellers","The hotel is located in the heart of downtown Windhoek (which is not a big city). The rooms at the hotel are comfortable and spacious. Wifi - which is not free - works well in the rooms. The hotel is in a shopping mall that is busy during the day but dies completely at night. Staff I found were general not particularly friendly or helpful, and the area was deserted and a little eerie after dark. Don't feel this is the best option for leisure travellers to Windhoek, but well located for business.","Date of stay: June 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The hotel offers good quiet rooms and comfortable beds. Breakfast was more than adequate. Situated in a shopping complex did not detract from the experience and indeed it was convenient to have a super market in the building. The staff were couteous and efficient and indeed the concierge was most helpful.The hotel is situated in central Winhoek and in walking distance of restaurants and shops.

"Very good city hotel in a central location for exploring Windhoek on your own","We chose the hotel as the starting point for our Namibia tour. The rooms are spacious and clean, breakfast is served as a buffet and offers a wide selection. The staff is very friendly, polite and accommodating. The pool is a bit misleading, as it is just a small plunge pool on the roof terrace. This cannot be used for swimming. The evening cocktails with a fantastic view over Windhoek are highly recommended.","Date of stay: November 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Facelifting reicht nicht","Seit fast 20 Jahren steige ich fast jedes Jahr im Avani (früher: Kalahari Sands) ab, weil es einfach zentral liegt. Avani hat dem Hotel ein Facelifting verpasst, das sehr ansprechend ist. Geht man jedoch ins Detail, finden sich alte Probleme wieder, die von unten nach oben größer werden.Das neue Avani hat seine Rezeption und eine Bar ins Erdgeschoss verlegt. Das ist sicherlich eine gute Idee gewesen. Die Gästebetreuerin Loretta macht (seit vielen Jahren) einen fantastischen Job. Die Porter Jürgen und Nick(?) sind unglaublich hilfsbereit und schnell mit dem Gepäck, die Rezeption ist hilfsbereit und hilft bei Problemen und Buchungen.Die Mitarbeitenden der Bar im Erdgeschoss sind sehr freundlich und arbeiten gästeorientiert. Alles zusammen: Note 1.Will man von dort nach oben fahren, gibt es im neuen Avani alte Probleme: der Aufzug!Schon früher dauerte es zu Stoßzeiten lange, bis der Lift zu den Etagen kam. Nun gibt es ein intelligenteres System, das ""Stockwerkhierarchien"" erkennt, wenn es denn funktioniert. Am 1. Tag funktionierten alle drei Aufzüge nicht. Danach ging es unterschiedlich weiter. Ich bin mehrfach im Lift steckengeblieben. Allerdings ging nach kurzer Zeit der Aufzug wieder.Die Zimmer sind wie sie immer waren, mal so, mal so. Wir waren an unterschiedlichen Tagen während einer 5wöchigen Reise im Avani. Die Zimmerbreite reichte von ganz toll und sehr groß bis zu kaputten Duschwänden mit nicht abziehbarer Toilette, von tropfenden Klimaanlage, nicht funktionierendem Safe u.a. Die Zimmer konnten wir allerdings sehr schnell wechseln.Im Restaurant angekommen, war es wie immer: das Buffet ist morgens wie abends mehr als gut. Eine große Vielfalt mit vielen frisch zubereiteten Gerichten zu einem vernünftigen Preis. Wenn man - wie wir - mehrere Tage am Stück im Avani verbringt, wird es schnell langweilig. Das Personal ist  freundlich und schnell, einige auch unfreundlich und langsam. Ausdrücklich hervorheben möchte ich die Damen an der Kasse, die Reservierungen oder besondere Tischzusammenstellungen für Gruppen sehr schnell und kurzfristig erledigen.Gesamtnote: 3+Eine einzige Katastrophe war die neue Rooftopbar. Es reicht nicht aus, eine Etage über der Skybar im Hilton platziert zu sein. Den Pool inmitten der Sitzplätze wird wohl niemand ernsthaft nutzen wollen. Neun Leute stehen für die Bar dort hinter der Theke und starren die Kasse an, ohne sich in irgendeiner Weise zu bewegen. Wir waren an den beiden Eröffnungstagen dort, und es klappte nichts. Am dritten Tag wurde die neue Bar wieder geschlossen, weil nichts klappte. Nach 2 Wochen waren wir wieder dort. Es war nicht möglich, jemanden zu bitten, eine Bestellung aufzunehmen, nach einer weiteren Woche und dann noch einmal weiteren 2 Wochen war der Service nicht besser. Ich kann den Service nicht bewerten, weil es keinen gab. Andere Gäste waren glücklicher und erzählten, dass nach einer Stunde jemand eine Bestellung aufgenommen hatte.Gesamtnote: 6-Unterm Strich: gilt: Erdgeschoss arbeitet fantastisch. Zimmer durchwachsen, wenn man sich beschwert, bekommt man schnell gute Zimmer, Restaurant: Essen gut, Service gut bis mittelmäßig; Roof Top Bar und Pool: Katastrophe","Date of stay: February 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A REAL improvement","The AVANI today used to be the Kalahari Sands Hotel ... but the renovation has changed this hotel around & upside down. Integrated a lovely little BISTRO at the bottom, next to reception. Free secure parking is still available,ask at the reception. Bedrooms are still on the old design & lay-out, but much lighter furnishing is used, very quiet, we slept well.  No breakfast is included in the price, a breakfast is at 250 NAD per person extra. This hotel is in City Centre, very good for business, across you have SLOWDOWN COFFEE , next to that an ICE CREAM PARLOUR and of course the BISTRO at AVANI ... nice places to go & have a light lunch or breakfast ... or just a good coffee. We were a bit hesitant booking this hotel coming from Seychelles, because the AVANI in Seychelles is old, stinky and definitely not new like this one. Their breakfast room has been upgraded, simpler but better quality. All over service friendly and efficient. Well DONE!","Date of stay: January 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Met expectations","I m very impressed by the quality service offered. Well trained people that have a high knowledge of working with people. I like the fact that there is always someone to attend to you whenever you want something at any given time. The speed of your Internet network intrigues me. I will never hesitate to recommend your hotel to a friend, family or any random acquaintance. The location is perfectly at the heat of Windhoek CBD which makes it easier for visitors to have prompt access to other services.","Date of stay: November 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good location","Location is good for shopping and seeing the sights.  Dinner was good.  Room was nice but there were problems with the elevator.  Food was good.  It is inside a shopping mall, you need to use the escalator in the mall to get to the hotel . When the escalator is not working,  carrying the bags was very difficult.  Tip ...If you are there on a Saturday the shops close early.","Date of stay: December 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Junious and his manager are to be commended","There was an issue when checking in to the presidential suite upon our arrival, and the initial staff member who dealt with the situation was well below par in her performance. I was very disappointed with the hotel on that occasion, so much so, that I almost changed our booking for our return visit. Upon returning, Junious greeted us at reception, and to his credit, I was pleasantly surprised when he remembered myself and my family from our previous visit. His manner and professionalism was outstanding. I also spoke to his Manager, a lovely woman whose name I can't remember, and she also was very professional and obviously passionate about her industry. The two of them are a credit to the Avani group. Having been in business for almost 30 years now, I would be proud to call either of them my staff member. All other staff members we interacted with were friendly and welcoming. Their restaurant was excellent, and we also used their downstairs bar for before and after dinner drinks, while watching the world cup and the bar staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough to help you. Bravo Avani.","Date of stay: July 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Stay away while renovating","What an awful experience. First room I was given, key didn't work. 2nd room already occupied. 3rd room was open. Room was serviced at 1815! Only 1 of 3 elevators worked. After waiting 10 minutes I was informed the down button on the 10th floor is not working. The one star is for breakfast which was great.","Date of stay: June 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A good hotel but with a few problems","The hotel is centrally located with shops and restaurants nearby.  The rooms are large and comfortable with a large bathroom and effective a/c, tv. fried etc.  There is a problem in that the reception is one floor up from the street and the downward escalator was not working.  The key card we were issued with did not work, the promised water was not initially supplied and the lifts did not always operate as promised.  Nonetheless the staff were friendly and did eventually sort out all the problems.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"FACILE CAR PROCHE DE L'AEROPORT","Bien localisé par rapport à l'aéroport (40mn) cet hôtel dispose de chambres très spacieuses avec deux grands lits. Très bonne literie. Frigo, tv, prises européennes dans la chambre. Wifi partout.Salle de bains fonctionnelle disposant de produits. Le restaurant propose une formule de buffets très variés et de très bonne qualité que ce soit le matin ou le soir. Le personnel en salle, de cuisine et à la réception sont très sympathiques et souriants. Il y a une salle de jeux dans l'hôtel et une galerie commerciale à la sortie.Quelques petits points négatifs : moquette dans les chambres, ascenseurs très lents (sur les 4 premiers étages + vite à pieds). Piscine : petite, glacée et eau légèrement saumâtre.","Date of stay: September 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"An Excellent Place to Stay in Windhoek","I have stayed at the AVANI Hotel on three occassions and have experienced excellent service where I have not had to call a receptonist, waitron or butler. There is always someone to assist with the lifts and which floor one needs to be. The restaurant staff are readily on hand to take your orders, clear used plates etc. The Reception staff acknowledge you even though they may be busy with someone else.What a pleasure to stay at the AVANI and I would not stay anywhere else in Windhoek.","Date of stay: September 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comfortable stay","I stayed at the Avani for 6 nights and overall had a very comfortable stay. There were a few cons to the hotel, but the bedroom and meals do make up for it.Pros:Amazing breakfast buffet! They serve almost every type of breakfast you can imagine. Lovely bedroom with big bed, flat screen, bath and shower.Friendly staffGreat coffee!Cons:Wifi only worked in the reception area and restaurant, in the bedroom it was very weak.Room service was poor - I called 3 times to remind them to bring my order.It was advertised online that there was a gym in the hotel, but there is no gym.The hotel is in the middle of a shopping mall in the city centre.","Date of stay: June 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"ordentliches Hotel mit Schwächen","Ich bin im Februar/März mit Unterbrechungen insgesamt 8 Nächte im Avani gewesen. 1. Fazit: Als Avani ist es genauso gut/schlecht wie als Kalahari Sands Hotel.Lage: ideal zum Zentrum gelegen. In wenigen Schritten ist man in der Innenstadt.Zimmer: sauber, geräumig, sehr gut. Safe vorhanden, Minibar auch, aber nicht gefüllt.Personal: sehr unterschiedlich. Rezeption: immer sehr gut und kompetent, bei Problemen stets um schnelle Lösungen bemüht. Restaurant: einige sehr nett, zuvorkommend und sehr um den Gast bemüht, andere völlig überfordert und inkompetent. Einige wenige mit ignoranter Arroganz. Beispiel: Der Getränkeausschank wurde wegen Umbaumaßnahmen auf die laute Terrasse verlegt. Eine Bierbestellung um 21.30 wurde nicht mehr angenommen, weil die Bar um 22.00 schließt.Beim 2. Besuch gab es wieder die ""alte"" Bar. Leider war keine Unterhaltung möglich, weil sehr laut Sportübertragungen oder andere Sendungen liefen. Da alle Zimmer TV haben, braucht die Bar diesen ""Service"" nicht auch noch zu bieten.Essen: bei einem längeren Aufenthalt merkt man, dass das Essen (außer freitags) immer das selbe ist. Buffet mit z.T. frischer Zubereitung und ausreichend, aber halt auch langweilig. Wenn Töpfe oder Schalen mit Salaten leer sind, dauert es lange, bis Nachschub kommt.Seit Jahrzehnten ein Dauerproblem: die drei Fahrstühle sind dem Gästeaufkommen nicht gewachsen. Gerade zu den Mahlzeiten geht man vom Zimmer besser zu Fuß als solange auf den Fahrstuhl zu warten, bis das Essen kalt geworden ist.","Date of stay: March 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Tolle Lage und gute Preise","Das Hotel liegt mitten in Windhoek und man kann fussläufig alles gut erreichen (Christuskirche, Zoo Park, Craft Centre,...). Die Buchung über die eigene Homepage war einfach, gut verständlich und schnell. Preise sind vollkommen ok, Frühstück ist inbegriffen. Das Frühstück war super lecker und vielfältig, auch das Abendbuffet war abwechslungsreich und man konnte sich sogar selbst etwas zusammenstellen und dann frisch grillen lassen. Die Bedienungen waren immer freundlich. In der Bar kann man den ganzen Tag über essen und die Portionen sind groß und lecker. Ausgaben, die man innerhalb des Hotels tätigt, kann man aufs Zimmer schreiben lassen. Die meisten Gäste sind Einheimische oder aus anderen afrikanischen Ländern, was uns sehr gefallen hat. Dadurch wirkte das Hotel nicht wie ein ""Touristentempel"". Die Zimmer sind großzügig geschnitten und verfügen über ein großes Bad und eine Klimaanlage. Im Kühlschrank im Zimmer werden jeden Tag 2 gratis Flaschen Wasser aufgefüllt. WLAN ist im ganzen Haus erreichbar. Der einzige Haken war, dass wir bei Ankunft mit gesamtem Gepäck durch die anliegende Mall über defekte Rolltreppen eiern mussten, da der Lift defekt war. Das ist aber nicht unbedingt die Schuld des Hotels, daher kann man darüber hinweg sehen.","Date of stay: December 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A decent hotel experience in an odd location","We were travelling from the UK and needed a decent base for our first night in Namibia following a long journey and prior to setting off on our adventure exploring the country.We were a little surprised when, travel-weary, we arrived in Windhoek and were directed to a shopping centre car park. It was a bit of a struggle finding the Avani reception but when we did the staff were very pleasant, the room was spotless and well appointed and the breakfast was a plentiful, corporate-style buffet. We had to travel out to experience anything of Windhoek or anything with real character, not being in a casino frame of mind! Could have been anywhere really as has the feel of an airport hotel. But can't fault the service, sleep or facilities. Would recommend overseas visitors stay somewhere with a touch more ""authenticity"" perhaps as we will next time we're over.","Date of stay: March 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"""its the little details that matter indeed""","29th july to august 1 - i enjoyed the great hospitality and warmness , great welkom and laughter too from every member of staff i encountered at the hotel.from the porters, and security to the supervisors and managers that i met briefly while staying with you - as my departure date and flight was rather early ,i was a bit disappointed that there was no one to assist in the dunes restaurant ( which only  starts breakfast service @ 6am), only after a few nudges with the hotel reception desk   , i had a chef come to assist  - and arranged for a quick meal for me and a breaky pack to take with - at least that helped -your buffets are wonderful, but i think steep - Hilton has good value for money too and slightly cheaper...( be competitive)one suggestion please  - kindly  realize that your national carrier airline has all international flights departing rather early on their schedule , please do make it a point to see that  when clients  travel itineraries are availed and you know their international flights depart early , please ensure that you offer your clients a breakfast  pack READY  to go, or better  a chef  and waiters in the restaurant to help clients have a quick meal before they leave the hotel for airport by 6 am.overall , i was happy to have stayed with you - was happy to have met lieze and oompie, great sounds and voices - beautiful people ..i thank you and will definitely be coming back to stay with you soonest . -with my family too. am sure the kids will enjoy it too.happy guest!!!!","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A little bit unusual access to the Reception","From the sidewalk you cross the mall of a Commercial Center, take the escalator to the first floor and have the entrance on your right. Some security guys around, so, it looks safe.The pool on the roof it small, but Namibia is a desert country, so, why complain? My criticism goes to the impossibility to have a free round look from the top floor. Sorry, no pictures! I would say that with some small improvements to take out the few sand out of the gears ( room key did not work and the safety box neither), it would be a perfect hotel with one of the best restaurants of Windhoek in short walking distance.","Date of stay: May 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"AAAC - Avoid at all cost","We stayed at the hotel on a Saturday night, having to catch the plane the Sunday. Very disappointed! Only buffet dinner with no choice of a la carte. Streets not safe enough to find another restaurant in the vicinity. In any case very little other restaurants in the area. Drinks are overpriced. We ordered dinner from a very limited in-room dining menu - supposed to be a cheese and ham platter, but the ham was ""something"" disguised as ham and the cheese old and mouldy! Gross! Had a bad night's rest due to very noisy neighbors. Breakfast was VERY average and definitely not 4-star standard.Warm and cold water taps of the wash basin were swopped and the one tap did not work at all.The entrance to the parking and to the reception are badly sign-posted. Would not have found these, if I were driving on my own.Would not recommend this hotel to anyone.","Date of stay: May 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"部屋はとても綺麗","ツアーで利用しました。部屋はとても綺麗でした。ただシャワーのお湯がぬるいうえに、真上に換気扇があるので寒くてシャワーを浴びるのが辛かったです。食事は他のホテルに比べると少し落ちるかなと感じました。あとレストランの従業員は少し愛想が悪かったように感じました。気のせいかもしれませんが。部屋は静かで問題無く眠れました。","Date of stay: July 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Mmmm - Some attention to detail please","I've stayed at the hotel on two occasions within a week. The room was very good, but I had a few ""not so good"" experiences. I only visited the restaurant for breakfast as I was too tired for dinner. Places should be set 100% with all cutlery - spoons at every cup. Plates should be placed at the breakfast point where the guest will dish up. The flow of the buffet should in a planned direction - not all over the place. Enough of the negatives.I had 150M of WiFi per night free, which was sufficient for the time in the hotel. The bathrooms were very clean and well appointed. Bed very comfortable and spacious. Will stay there again.","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Well appointed","The room was comfortable, clean and well appointed, and nice to have a good view over the city. The work area could have benefited from a more suitable desk chair, but it was good to have internet access. My room was opposite one of the service rooms, and there was quite a bit of noise early in the morning with staff moving in and out with cleaning equipment. There is a good selection of television channels and room service was prompt, with a fair range of reasonably priced meals. The breakfast was adequate, although staff could have been a bit more attentive. There was a delay during check-in of 30-minutes, although I checked in after 2pm.","Date of stay: September 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Bottom of the pile","My girlfriend and I have just returned from a holiday in Namibia. We stayed in 3 hotels throughout the country, 2 were exceptional, 1 was terrible. Sadly this was the Kalahari Sands. Despite the location & housekeeping cleanliness being excellent this was a truly awful experience for 2 reasons:- Bad bad bad staff attitudes. This ruined the overall stay having to deal with rude, inattentive & inhospitable staff. The worst of which was a lady on the main reception (closely followed by the waitresses in the restaurant).- Poor quality food served on the buffet. Perhaps this was exaggerated by the terrible staff attitudes, however I'm always amazed at the buffet dogma of offering many dishes of low quality rather than a few tasty dishes. Specifically poor quality meat & no attention to how the food was presented.Fix the staff attitudes & improve the quality of food in the buffet (even if you raise the price) and this would be a much nicer hotel.","Date of stay: December 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Solides Hotel - Super Frühstück","Dieses 4 Sterne Hotel gehört zu den besten in Windhoek. Wir hatten es über einen grossen deutschen Reiseveranstalter gebucht und zu einem super Preis bekommen. Die Zimmer sind schon älter, teilweise hat man eine grossartige Aussicht auf Windhoek! Direkt vor dem Hotel ein kleiner Souveniermarkt! Der Weg durch das Einkaufszentrum ins Hotel ist etwas kompliziert!

"keine 3 Sterne","Wir waren Ende Mai 2010 im obigen Hotel. Am Empfang ging es schon los. Unfreundlich und sehr langsam. Viele schreiben die Zimmer wären gut. Das stimmt. Allerdings im Bad hatte es Schimmel an den Fliesenfugen. Nebenan in unmittelbaren Nachbarschaft wird ein Gebäude hoch gezogen. Ab morgens um 6.30 Uhr ist an Schlafen nicht mehr zu denken. Das Wasser im Pool hatte gerade mal 15 Grad Celsius. Also von wegen baden!!Viel Personal aber oft unfreundlich. Das Personal kommt auf die Dachterasse an den Pool um öfters eine Zigarettenpause zu machen. Der Rauch ist sehr störend. In jeder Lodge hatten wir zumindest ein TV mit Naxchrichten aus Deutschland. In diesem Hotrel aber nicht. (5 Sterne???)Nie mehr Kalahari Sands.

"Regretted my stay in Kalahari Sands","It all started at the reception area when we arrived.The ladies were arrogant and very impatient with us.The reception we got was very very unwelcoming.We booked into the ""luxury room"".Okay,the room was quite nice,big and well kept.We headed out to the resturant for dinner.None of the waiters even gave us a smile.we had to ask to be served with a drink.The buffet was not enjoyable at all. Also breakfast was just standard. We were there for 2 nights.The next day,we went out and came back around 1:30pm.only to find our room not made.We called housekeeping,they cleaned there and then,But to our disappointment again they could not offer us clean towels and sheets,apparently because the storeroom for towels was locked. The pool was unkept and unclean.I regretted staying in Kalahari Sands,especially that they dont treat clients with worth and value.Service levels are so so poor,en i did not appreciate at all.  Paying so much ,you expect a certain standard Service.But what experienced in Kalahari Sands was not even half of my expectation.","Date of stay: December 2008This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"If I could give a zero rating, I would","I have travelled all over the world for business and pleasure. This is in the top 2 worst hotels I haves rated in. The other was a dingy place in northern Zambia.Service is definitely the worst of any hotel I have stayed in. I arrived at reception with my family around check in time. I was there on business and they wanted to see Windhoek sites. We checked in and I was told 15 minutes for our rooms to be ready as they wanted to put us on the same floor. We said it wasn’t necessary. After a couple of enquiries, they got us rooms almost 2 hours later, on different floors. Which we had to check in for again. Then they were upset with us because we were frustrated.They also ran out of key cards, so each room only received one key.I can speak for a very long time about the awful service across the hotel at every engagement with staff.The rooms are ok. Most things worked, but it is old, but mostly renovated. Room service took three attempts at reaching them, then the 15-30 minutes wait time was an hour and the order they delivered was wrong.A very painful stay.","Date of stay: September 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Incredible service","Fluffy pillows and spacious rooms… this place is incredible. I visited for the first time Namibia and was thoroughly impressed by the entire experience. The service stood out above all else, particularly at the bar. The staff were not only friendly and professional but also went out of their way to make each guest feel welcome. Every drink was crafted with precision, and the bartenders had an impressive knowledge of cocktails, offering both classic favorites and unique creations. They were attentive, always making sure our glasses were never empty, and their warm conversations added a personal touch to our evenings.Beyond the bar, the entire hotel was impeccably maintained, with a serene atmosphere that allowed for both relaxation and adventure. The rooms were spacious, clean, and offered stunning views of the Namibian landscape. The dining experience was exceptional, with a menu that showcased the best of local and international cuisine. The hotel also offered excellent amenities, from the pool to guided tours, making it easy to explore the beautiful surroundings.I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Namibia. Whether you’re there for the wildlife or simply to unwind, the impeccable service—especially at the bar—ensures a memorable stay. I can’t wait to return!","Date of stay: October 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Clean, comfortable room and friendly service","Service at reception and check in was very friendly and helpful. Reception staff also arranged a taxi and reservation at a restaurant.My room was very comfortable and clean and offered everything I needed. The hotel was being renovated while I was there, which was a bit of an inconvenience.The hotel restaurant was nice, but a little pricey for the variety and quality. I had breakfast and dinner here and both were average. Very little vegetarian options (even potato salad contained ham).Positives:Free Wifi worked very well in room.Complimentary water in bar fridgePillow menu (which I did not get to try, sadly)The hotel is situated in a little shopping mall with food and clothing stores, a pharmacy, a department store with gifts and souvenirs and a few small daytime restaurants.Negatives:Only one lift was working, so getting in and out took some time waiting or taking stairs to 9th floor.Upon arrival the tv and air conditioner in the room were both out of order, so my first night was a hot one.The shower door in the room came off its rails every time I opened or close it.On two occasions cleaning staff enter my room without knocking while I was there (I checked in early).","Date of stay: November 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ottimo hotel a Windhoek","E' un hotel proprio nel centro di Windhoek con l'entrata al primo piano di una galleria commerciale. Le stanze sono molto grandi, pulite, confortevoli e con tutti i comfort. Il ristorante é a self service con una scelta molto vasta dove c'é solo l'imbarazzo della scelta,  comodo il prezzo fisso molto conveniente a cui aggiungere solo le bevande. All'entrata oltre alla reception c'é anche un casino dove passa diversa gente. Abbiamo passato qui l'ultima notte in Namibia  ricordando con nostalgia i nostri campi tendati.Consiglio questo hotel perché é in centro si puo' uscire tranquillamente a fare spese, e nelle vicinanze si puo' andare a visitare la vecchia chiesa di Windhoek e i giardini dove crescono bellissimi fiori tipo jakaranda e bouganville.","Date of stay: November 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Durchschnittliches Hotel in guter Lage","Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral an der Haupteinkaufsstrasse und die meisten Sehenswürdigkeiten von Windhoek kann man bequem zu Fuß erreichen. Durch das angrenzende Parkhaus mit direktem Übergang zum Hotel ist das Hotel auch für PKW - Reisende zu empfehlen. Unten im Gebäudekomplex befindet sich ein kleines Einkaufszentrum mit Supermarkt, was zum Auffüllen der Vorräte sehr praktisch ist.Damit sind aber auch bereits alle positiven Aspekte aufgezählt worden. Das Personal war nicht sonderlich freundlich und wollte uns trotz gültiger Onlinebuchung ein anderes Zimmer zu einem erhöhten Preis zuweisen. Das erhaltene Zimmer war ausgesprochen klein und nicht sonderlich gut eingerichtet.","Date of stay: October 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There is a better selection at lunch than at dinner. Meat lovers and seafood lovers are catered for. All you can eat oysters for lunch and Chinese Chow Mein as desired. The Stratos (rooftop terrace bar) has the best views and the bar boasts with a variety of imported drinks. Slight criticism is the music played at the rooftop bar that doesn’t cater for everyone.

"Very nice place","The rooms here are very comfy and clean, nice looking - actually exceeded my expectations. The buffet lunch was better than the breakfast but both are fairly good. The only nitpicks would be the shower is tiny, which is odd given how large the bathroom is (why not just have the shower in the tub?) and the elevators were extremely crowded and slow. The women at the front desk are very nice and helpful and let me have a late checkout which was great considering my flight was late. Some rooms have better views than others. The first time I stayed here I was looking at a construction site but the second time I had a higher floor with mountain and city views.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Qualidade e Bom Gosto a Preço Justo","Situado no centro da baixa da capital namíbiana, repleta de edifícios históricos que datam da época colonial alemã,o Hotel & Casino Avani é a opção mais acertada para quem procura onde ficar em Windhoek com todo o conforto e com uma boa relação preço qualidade.Encontra-se a cerca de 30km do aeroporto, e perto de tudo quanto á de interessante para ver e fazer na cidade; para os amantes de arquitectura Windhoek tem uma interessante mistura de arquitectura moderna com edifícios históricos que valem a pena serem visitados, incluindo a Alte Feste (Antigo Forte) e a Christuskirche (Igreja de Cristo), para os amantes de artesanato está a cinco minutos a pé do interessantíssimo Arts & Crafts Center onde pode encontrar de todo o tipo de artesanato oriundo de todos os cantos do país e os amantes de gastronomia também ficaram satisfeitos pois está localizado perto dos melhores restaurantes de Windhoek, entre eles o famosíssimo ""Joe's"".O Hotel & Casino Avani, oferece quartos muito bem decorados e com um máximo de conforto (conectividade total Wi-Fi, mini-bar...)

"Buen hotel","El hotel está en el mismo edificio de un centro comercial, con lo cual estas rodeado de tiendas. En el sótano también hay un supermercado. Al otro lado de la calle también hay un mercadillo de artesanía. La zona está en expansión y había algún edificio al lado en construcción. Al asomarte por las ventanas te das cuenta de lo pequeña que es la ciudad y que este edificio es de los más altos de la zona.Estuvimos en él nada más llegar a Namibia y aunque la capital es muy pequeñita en comparación con las capitales europeas el hotel es grande y tiene estilo internacional. Habitación  y cuarto de baño amplios, buenos e impecables. Las instalaciones comunes  están bastante bien. El desayuno, estilo bufet, nos gustó; tenía varios alimentos estilo africano y también productos de estilo internacional.Fue un buen comienzo para nuestra aventura en Namibia!","Date of stay: August 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Culture of anti-service","So the hotel is mediocre and the staff is disinterested, but the deal with the internet is horrendous.First, you can't get internet service at the front desk.  You are required to go up a floor to the ""business center.""  Like I said, it is almost as if they brain-stormed way to make accessing wifi as painful as possible.  So either go up to your room to put down you luggage and come back downstairs to but an internet voucher, or drag all you stuff with you.Then wait in line, because the process takes for ever and there is always a line.  So then, it turns out that they give out vouchers at the front desk after the business center closes for hte evening.  So I asked the clerk why they couldn't just hand out the vouchers when you check in, instead of fording everyone to go to a whole different part of the hotel?  Her answer was ""then what would I do?""  So the hotel is essentially inconveniencing it's guests to make work for another employee to sell you internet service.  It's anti-service.Then choose an overpriced internet access plan from the menu.  And if the system works they print you off a voucher that then lets you know that you have purchased ""bandwidth shaped"" wifi.  Bandwidth shaped, in this case means that the network is throttled down to dial up speed.Now you have spent 30 minutes to purchased internet that is painfully slow, kicks you off every twenty minutes and is overpriced.  Thanks for making my stay miserable.Post script  - It took me three attempts to post this review, because the stupid, punish the customer internet service requires me to log in every few minutes.... aaarrrrrrrrghhhhhh!!!!!!!!","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Average yet practical","I stayed at this hotel in April 2013. I was travelling on business. The room was comfortable and spacious with two double beds. , the quality of deco was good, food at restaurant was average and the service was average. For a four star it  was not too bad. However friends of mine who were travelling with me complained about their rooms , apparently , the wing where I stayed was newly renovated. Theirs was the old wing , one of them spotted a cockroach in her room. Not quite what you would expect in a hotel room. No gym inside the hotel. Hotel located in a shopping mall in the business district which was practical as I was 2min from the office. They have a casino for those who like to gamble. They have a pool on the roof top, with limited space though.

"Hotel centrale e ottime camere","Ottima posizione nella zona dei negozi.Camere pulite, confortevoli e spaziose, bagni anche (doccia e vasca separate).Il ristorante a buffet è buono, c'è ampia scelta per la cena e anche per la colazione.L'ultimo giorno dovendo partire prima dell'apertura del ristorante, ci hanno fatto prenotare la colazione in camera senza alcun extra.Non ho avuto tempo per poter usufruire degli altri servizi, come la spa.","Date of stay: August 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Schlechtestes hotel unserer 2 wöchigen Namibiareise","Absolute Enttäuschung . Waren mit 4 köpfiger Famlilie vorher auf einer Farm in Omaruro und hatten telefonisch spomtan die letzte Übernachtung in Windhoek vor Abflug gebucht. Auschhlaggebend war vor allem für die kids der Pool auf dem Dach. Bei Ankunft ( nicht bereits bei Buchnung, wir wären sonst auf der Farm geblieben ;-)) erfuhren wir, daß nicht nur der Pool, sondern auch das gesamte Hotel ""under construction"" ist. Trotz Nachfrage wurden uns keine Alternariven in Windhoek angeboten. Am nächsten Morgen begann der Baulärm um 6:00, die Cornflakes beim Frühstück bestamdem aus 3 übrig gebliebenden Krümeln, ein Nachschub war nicht möglich, der warme Kakao brauchte 30 (!) Mintuten. Alles in allem herscht hier die Beklemmung der 80er DDR Jahre. Absolut nicht empfehlenswert !!!!!!!!","Date of stay: April 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I cannot leave out Desiree, Lorenzo, Jay, and one other gentleman whose name unfortunately I can not recall, for ensuring that everything ran well.Although there were some challenges with sound at the beginning, they promptly ensured that the issues were resolved on time without delays.I would highly recommend their facilities to any organization for their conferencing & Hotel facilities.

"Windhoek’s best rooftop","Would I stay here during my next visit. Yes, I would. Avani hotel is located on Independence Street in the very city center, very, very close to Christuskirche and the Independence Museum, shopping mall (one is the same building), cafes etc.You have super views over the city from the hotel sky bar and restaurant. Food was good. Perfect for sunsets. The pool is small, but with amazing views. The gym is small. Breakfast was good, but very crowded when I was there.  It is not like Avani Riverside and Seen sky bar in Bangkok where I just came from, might expectations where not the best arriving here.  My conclusion is that I still really like Avani Windhoek even though it is time for an update.","Date of stay: August 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Rude, lazy and incompetent casino staff.","Tonight I visited the casino at Avani Hotel and Casino in Windhoek. I was shocked to the core to witness a staff member, infact one of the pit bosses Otilie getting in an argument with a client, after a customer dispute on the roulette table. I don't know the exact bone of contention, but having to watch a senior employee with the company threatening to physically beat and assault a client to the point that her colleagues had to hold her back shocked me to the core.Irregardless what the customer did or said to anger her, she should have removed herself from the situation and let her colleagues deal with the client that was visibly upset.The sad part about this is that this type of incidences has been a regular occurrence here, and on top of it you have staff that are plain rude, lazy and incompetent. When you complain about the disgusting customer service, they tell you to go somewhere else if you not happy with them.Management has been informed numerous times but they don't seem to care!","Date of stay: December 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Solid experience","During my 1st visit to Namibia, the Avani was my hotel of choice.  From reception, to the rooms, to the dining area, it was pretty much standard for a business stay.  Friendly staff was the highlight.  The hotel offered exactly what you would expect.  I would say the lowlight was that the hotel pool was undergoing renovations, and in the Windhoek heat (35 degree + for the week) a pool to cool down would have been really welcome.Would I stay there again?  Yes I would. It’s central location is probably the biggest selling point.","Date of stay: November 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Second Visit- Staff on Point ","I visited Windhoek on business, for one night. I walked into a newly renovated foyer and friendly staff. I was not too happy on arrival, the hotel arranged for city cabs to pick me up from the airport but I was left waiting for an hour. The front desk manager and reception staff were very eager to listen to my complaint and follow up with the cab company.  The hotel is under renovation, expect a lot of drilling noises and slow elevators(if this is new, that is disappointing). I noted a few issues and handed it to reception on check out and I was happy with the level of customer service I received. Well done to all the staff, who knew of Mrs. Naidoo and her complaints. Keep up the great service, I will be back, hopefully the third time’s the charm!","Date of stay: July 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Run form this hotel","This hotel was beyond awful.  There were bird feces all over the windows (the entire side of the hotel), no garage, hotel under construction.  Elevators take forever.  When we called to complain, no one answers at reception so we packed our bags and immediately checked out.  They said it was a holiday (December 26) so limited staff but that is no excuse for a hotel.  Could not print out boarding pass (printer down) etc..We moved to a fantastic hotel on same street.  Avani called us there to apologize and said to contact Expedia and they would authorize a full refund and it has been a month and still no refund from the Avani or Expedia after numerous calls.Hotel is in major need of renovation and experienced, accountable staff.","Date of stay: December 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Het hotel was ideaal gelegen, alles bevond zich op wandelafstand, geen geluidshinder, proper, alles in orde. Op de bovenste verdieping was een klein zwembadje aanwezig. In het restaurant hebben wij alleen ontbijt genomen en dit was prima in orde. Een klein minpuntje: het hotel was aan het renoveren en overdag (tijdens de werken) was slechts één lift beschikbaar.

"Great Location","Stayed for a couple of nights for the first of a series of visits to Windhoek and I will certainly be booking here again. Nice large room with views over the city towards the mountains.The hotel is conveniently located for the CBD and attractions such as the zoo park, craft market and parliament gardens. Food in the restaurant is a buffet for all meals although room service meals are available. I found the choices to be good for me, and at around £18 for the dinner buffet generally good value compared to other hotels I have stayed in around the world. The price is higher than local restaurants and food outlets, but that is normal for a hotel.Service was excellent throughout, with polite and respectful service from all staff I met from reception, restaurant or housekeeping. The only downside was redevelopment work which was a little noisy at times but did not disturb sleep.","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Potential for better, but decent experience","The site itself is lovely, and being in the heart of Windhoek, amenities are close by. However, I just cannot tolerate that this hotel is sharing its space with a mall - I felt a bit clumsy and insecure walking through the mall to the reception with my luggage with onlookers everywhere. check-in took an age and a half, check-out even longer (some arguments and altercations regarding ""children's"" breakfasts). An inconsistency on the Sun website and the hotel - Sun International accepts ""children"" aged under 18, yet the hotel charged my family with kids in their mid-teens as adults (full price). The receptionists argued a lot with me, unable to sympathise with my plight, and were quite rude, refusing to accept my ""thank you's"" despite me having to, against my will, pay the full fee. The rooms were decent and spacious,fairly clean as well. Very disappointed with the breakfast (at the price I paid) - no great variety compared to its 4-star competitors, and was not value for money.

"Slow and ignorant service, nice premises","Rooms, lobby and restaurant (incl. buffet) ok, but service very hard to get, even by phone and sometimes even at the reception desk. Prepare to be patient especially in the restaurant, and do not bother when cleaning lady is entering your with her own keys in the morning at 8 (""oh, you are in"").

"albergo comodo ma senza personalità","Si tratta di un grande albergo nel centro di Windhoek. Le stanze sono spaziose pulite comode e ben arredate, e la posizione dell'albergo è ottima per fare una passeggiata nel centro città. Nel complesso però l'albergo manca di personalità nel senso che è simile a qualsiasi altro grande albergo per affari che si può trovare in altre città del mondo. Fastidiosa è la presenza nella hall dell'albergo del casinò con un via vai pressocchè continuo di gente che bivacca fra i divani della hall e le slot machines, non si capisce perchè non abbiano previsto di separare gli ingressi! La colazione è stata abbondante e gustosa.","Date of stay: October 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN","We stayed in this hotel on a stop in Windhoek in Dec 2010.  The service stunk, the rooms stunk (of smoke), the bed was extremely uncomfortable and the pool was pathetic.  The steps to the pool were falling off the wall!   I seriously have never stayed in such a bad hotel and it was so expensive.  There is only one reason to stay in this hotel - its location and even that is bad. Wait until the other hotel is built - I hope they tear this down.","Date of stay: December 2010This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Höchste Zeit,dass das Hilton nebenan eröffnet!!!","Wir waren am Anfang und Ende unserer Reise in dem Hotel. Es war somit kein schöner Start und auch leider kein schönes Ende. Das einzig gute ist die zentrale Lage und das angeschlossene Einkaufszentrum mit Supermarkt, Souvenirgeschäften und Bankautomaten. Der ""Service"" an der Rezeption ist sehr langsam, unfreundlich und unzuverlässig. Messages erhält man nur per Zufall oder zu spät. Wofür ist eigentlich die Welcome Lounge im unteren Geschoss? Welcome Drinks gab es nur widerwillig und auf Nachfrage. Die Angestellten grüßen nicht. Aufzüge sind eine einzige Zumutung, pro Fahrt ca. 10 Minuten einplanen. Zimmer sind ok, aber schon ziemlich abgewohnt. Fazit: wir können kaum auf die Eröffnung des Hiltons gleich gegenüber warten, vielleicht ändert sich dann endlich was.","Date of stay: March 2010This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"OK Business Hotel - think 1980's Forte Posthouse","I was booked into the Kalahari Sands by my company - as a big customer i think we get a very good rate!Looking at the website, having stayed at other Sun International Hotels (Gabrone Sun) and looking at thier in house booklet I thought the hotel would be of a high standard and well maintained.  You will notice that the Sun website has very few pictures of the hotel!Arrival is a bit strange - either though the multi-storey car park or at the front via the shopping centre.  The lobby is quite grand - although dated - and there are G4S Security guards everywhere (who double up as porters).  Check in was friendly and fast and I was staying on the 7th floor.  The building is a 14 storey 1960's concrete monstrosity - but right in the City Centre - easy and seemingly safe walking distance to the main sights and station.I notice a lot of past reviews commenting on the lifts - they are currently replacing these.The hotel claims to have a Sauna and Gym on the roof terrace - but I could not find it (unless it is in the wellness centre).  The roof top pool however was very nice (although quite small) - and possibly the best feature of the hotel!The room was enormous with 2 double beds, DSTV (which kept going off and retuning one night) a work desk and large bathroom.  The room has WiFi Internet Access (payable) and a multi naiton plug (but only by the desk!).  The rooms - like most of the hotel - are very dated - think 1980's Forte Posthouse.  Fixtures and fittings very old fashioned and in some cases in need of replacement.  The beds are quite soft and could probably do with new mattrasses.  Having said all that the rooms are very large with good views (although not much to look at!) and very light and airy with quiet air conditioning.  The rooms are also very quiet (although mine was to the side of the hotel).The buffet breakfast had a good range - a bit strange with cooked to order bacon and sausage etc (the beans, mushrooms etc are in pots buffet style) - so not great for a quick bite if thats what you are after - but they have good juices, a wide range of meats and fish, cheese, salad, cereals and pastries etc and also offer cooked to order omlettes and eggs.  Trying to get a coffee was a little harder as they dont seem to offer it - rather you have to ask for it.  The sun deck is a nice place to enjoy your breakfast although the view is not very good - a large surface carpark and the busy Independence Avenue.The hotel restaurant offers buffet & ""cooked at the buffet"" meals.  Cooked for you are stir-fry with chicken, beef, pork, seafood, the usual veggies and rice or noodles.  They also cook steak versions of the meats plus fish.  They have a number of stews, veggies, salads etc.  The quality was not great and the restuarant atmosphere and service is poor.  The carpets need replacing with large tears and threadbear in parts!  OK - but I would recommend one of the better restaurants nearby and very close to the hotel.The bar is OK - but lots of smokers.  Prices not too bad - but obviously more expensive than outside the hotel.The casino is a good size with a large number of slots and table games.  Brught and busy and good fun.","Date of stay: December 2008This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Overall great hotel with some minor flaws","The hotel itself was clean, the staff was friendly, the location was good and breakfast has a big variety. The gym was well equipped and good enough for two nights! However, we stayed there twice with 2 weeks inbetween and both times we didn't have any towels in our room. When we asked for towels it took them almost an hour to provide us with some. Second the pool is very small, and it is very noisy as it is in the restaurant so not really useable. And the last thing that bothered us the most was, that when we went to the rooftop restaurant (the one with the pool) it took them an hour and a half to deliver out food. When I ordered food they did not have any of the stuff i wanted, why put it on the menu then? But the biggest faux par was when we ordered pasta. On the menu it said broccoli pasta with parmesan, but what we got was a mushroom pasta with spinach (they didn't even have such pasta on the menu???). When we talked to them the waitress said she's sorry but didn't offer any compensation and also didn't ask if we wanted something else and didn't even know that it said broccoli on the menu? Overall good hotel just avoid the restaurant and don't expect a pool.","Date of stay: March 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It might be a nice hotel once renovations are finished","At 9 pm at night we had difficulties locating the entrance to the hotel.  When driving by there were a number of big trucks blocking the view from the street as you’re driving by, so very hard to see it on approach. Parking was also difficult to find and there was work going on which meant access was not good or attractive. Also a number of sex workers were hanging around the parking entrance.  The hotel had difficulties finding our booking we had to wait 35 minutes before we got a room. The room (701) was quite large in size and beds were comfortable. In terms of eating at the hotel, we only had breakfast - it was average at best.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Mediocre experience at best","The Avani is well located within a shopping centre and a couple of upmarket shops are close by.   It is also within walking distance of the banking business district.  The room was large, clean and spacious, with a very nice bathroom.  The breakfast buffet was good.This hotel has what it takes to be very nice, but a lot of training and effort needs to go into the staff.  They are all mostly very gracious, but here are a couple of things that in my opinion should not happen at a 4 star hotel:•	Upon check in, I provided my GHA Discovery number.  On check out, it had not been recorded•	No list of amenities was anywhere to be found in the room, other than a room service card•	Almost impossible to willingly choose a bottle of wine for room service as no wine list seemed to be available.  Eventually I said “just send me a bottle of South African Sauvignon Blanc”!  This arrived well after I had eaten my food and with no wine glass accompanying it.•	A staff member manning the lift area asked me for money for cigarettes•	I arranged a late check out the day before I left.  Shortly after normal check out time, I received a phone call asking me when I would be leaving.  Upon explaining that I had pre-arranged to leave 2 hours later I was informed there was no record on file.Next time I will book in at the Hilton.","Date of stay: January 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great breakfast but relatively bad service experience","We stayed in Avani for 2 nights with friends. Hotel is located inside a shopping mall, which is bit odd and not cozy. However, the breakfast was really amazing and definitely the best of all our 5 hotels in Namibia. But unfortunately the service was not that great: 2/3 of the elevators were broken for whole our stay and it took over 40 mins to queue to the elevators with our luggage when we arrived. Also, none of the elevators worked in our floor, so we always needed to climb at least 1-2 floors with the big luggage, baby equipment etc. to get an elevator. The hotel staff did not offer their help in bringing our staff to the room even though it was located in 9th floor, and we needed to climb there the whole way! In the end way paid for one of employees to do so and claimed the stairs for 2 days. The pool located in the 14th floor, so you can only imagine how many stairs we climbed during the 2 days. I cannot imagine how they do not fix the elevators as soon as possible, when they notice them broken. Or give any discount to the guests when causing that big harm for them. Many in our group had fever during our stay, so it was really rough to climb 9 floors continously. In addition, there were lack of towels continuously in our room. The staff didn't understand at all, that since we had booked an extra bed for extra guest, of course he/she would need towels as well. We needed to call continuously to the reception to fix our room, it was really frustrating.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It's fine","No, really, it's fine.  I had a pleasant enough three week stay there, between mid September and early October.  My conclusion?  Yes, it's fine.  I was a little bit worried given some of the reviews here, but I'm pleased to write I was mostly happy.  So what's to like?- Large clean, renovated room, with comfortable bed- Clean, functional bathroom- Proper satellite TV (with receiver in every room) with a good selection of channels - The typical African hotel buffet restaurant is better than many I've been to  (though not as good as the often excellent Southern Sun Oliver Tambo, at Johannesburg Airport)- The bar is friendly, with a decent enough selection drinks, and the bar grub (fish and chips, steak, burger and so on) is decent enough- Responsive, friendly front desk (though it did take a few calls to get them to come and sort my telly out, one evening)- Reasonably prompt room service- Hotel is in the centre of the city, though you may have to put up with views of the swanky new Hilton- There's an empty fridge in the room and a supermarket downstairs (and nature abhors an empty fridge, so mine was rarely empty)- And the glassware, made of actual glass,  is refreshed daily (compared to the disposable, plastic and polystyrene everything you get in a four star hotel in the US, and increasingly in Europe).So what's not to like?- The room was a twin (thank you, thank you, thank you, beloved corporate travel agent), but I think they could have made room for a more comfortable chair (could never find a comfortable reading position in the room)- Internet is slow (albeit reliable, as opposed to West Africa, where the internet is twice as fast and half as reliable)- House Keeping a bit mean with the soap.Tips:- Try to get a room facing the city (the view from the Hilton is great, but the view of the Hilton is not so great)- Try to avoid a twin room- On week nights, I'd say it is probably safe to walk up and down Independence avenue (walking in the opposite direction of the Hilton, and no more than two blocks) until around 8PM- On a Saturday morning, do visit the gardens of the Tintenpalast, and the craft markets- On a Saturday afternoon, the Hilton's rooftop bar is well worth a visit- For a Sunday, visit the front desk and see if you can arrange a tour (I recommend a game drive, at the Okapuka ranch - Windhoek is pretty dead on a Sunday afternoon)- If faster internet is vital, take an unlocked smartphone and buy a local pre paid SIM (MTC offers various data bundles that are reasonable value for money, and allows tethering).","Date of stay: September 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"10 years later, big time upgrades and improvement to rooms","Service here has always been excellent. I've never had a problem at the ""Sands"" and this was my fifth stay. Also I've never managed not to win some extra spending holiday cash at the Casino. Maybe just lucky that way but it certainly helps with petrol and expenses when vacationing. The location can't be beat because of ""Checkers"" supermarket directly underneath it in the foyer. Ideal for getting water, snacks and supplies for the trip ahead. There is a cafe next to the Supermarket that has afforable breakfasts, good quality coffee and service if you want to save some money. The staff have always been friendly. Breakfast is great but expensive compared to the cafe next to Checkers. Dinner menu is buffet style and I found the choices limited. Still, compared to the newly opened (2011) Hilton Hotel that competes with it this place has character, more to do and is in a better location. We did check out the Hilton while we were there but it was a relatively, umm, sterile is the best word, experience. The rooms are being progressively upgraded, so try to ask for one of the renovated rooms. Compared to my last stay in 2001, the new beds, renovated bathrooms and clean carpets are welcome additions. Not cheap but an excellent place to rest up after a long flight before starting your adventure.","Date of stay: August 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Standard Fare","Avani is a very typical business hotel. Nothing offensive, nothing exciting. We were surprised though that the rooms weren't ready for two of our travellers even though we arrived after 5pm - that's a late check-in to be so ill prepared for. We did get a personalised written apology and a platter of snacks waiting in the room when we returned after dinner.Was disappointing that the upstairs deck bar was closed - what a huge miss to not enjoy a drink with the wonderful view.The front-desk was always exceptionally busy - definitely understaffed which is a shame as the staff were clearly under tremendous pressure.Breakfast, your standard buffet. All good there.Wouldn't stay again but also wouldn't recommend specifically against it.","Date of stay: October 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Locked in the elevator","we stayed in this hotel on July 31st 2018 and the lift worked wrongly and we got stuck in the elevator. We pressed the emergency  button several times and nobody answered and nobody helped us during 10 minutes. As we had the telephone number of the front desk of the hotel, we decided to phone with our cell phone to the front desk to explain the situation ""we are locked in the elevator, please help us"".After 10 minutes later we continued stuck in the elevator and nobody came to assist us and to be interested in what it was really happening. We were in the elevator for 20 minutes without any assitance and suddenly and finally the door opened and we went downstairs to the front desk really angry and dissapointed to ask for some explanation why nobody has assisted us. We talked with the Front Desk Manager and the only thing tha we received was a brief apologize and she did not show any worries about the situation. In our opinion, this is totally inacepptable.","Date of stay: July 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good hotel in city centre","The hotel (now called Avani Hotel) is right in the city centre and, oddly, is entered through a shopping centre. The rooms are modern, well fitted out and a reasonable size. Beds are comfortable but the push-buttons to control room lighting are odd and don't work 100%. The staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet is excellent. The restaurant only offers buffets (a bit pricey for lunch/dinner) and an a la carte menu is available in the bar. The bar is comfortable but can be a bit seedy at times as it's next door to the hotel  casino, also the bar staff are not as customer-oriented as the rest of the hotel staff. There are a few restaurants within walking distance but you have to be a bit careful walking in Windhoek at night..","Date of stay: July 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Un buon posto per iniziare e finire il circuito Namibia","Ho soggiornato in questo hotel il primo e l'ultimo giorno del mio viaggio in Namibia.Si trova sulla centralissima Independence Avenue, la zona dello shopping, dei negozi e dei ristoranti. E' un posto funzionale, un palazzone moderno, non nuovissimo, ma ha tutto ciò che serve. Le camere sono abbastanza spaziose e pulite, i letti comodi, il breakfast è buono e abbondante. Adatto a chi vuole potersi muovere autonomamente a piedi, dal momento che i lodges più ""affascinanti"" sono tutti fuori città. Al piano terra c'è un casino', piuttosto frequentato da ospiti e clientela di passaggio.","Date of stay: October 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Exellent hôtel","L'hôtel est idéalement situé dans la capitale de la Namibie : Windhoek . C'est un luxueux 4 étoiles disposant de chambres avec un grand lit et d'une salle de bain avec baignoire et douche . On trouve également un casino ouvert de 10 h 00 à 4 h 00 où l'on peut venir tenter sa chance . L'hôtel se trouve en plein centre ville et près de tous les commerces , quoique , jouxtant l'hôtel , une galerie marchande avec plein de boutiques , et cela sans presque sortir de l'hôtel .","Date of stay: September 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ongoing refurbishment much needed","We stayed here one night prior to a trip to Etosha as well as one night after and got two different room experiences. The first night we had a standard room wich was ok but not perfect. The room was spaceous but guite dark and very much in need of refurbishment. The same can be said for the rest of the hotel. Although clean, almost every piece of furniture was totally worn out. Luckily the hotel is refurbishing as we speak so I assume that in a year or so the hotel will be much better. We got a little preview on our second stay as we opted for a de luxe room. This room was bright new, spacious and comfortable with a huge bathroom with both a shower and a bath.Both breakfast and dinner was buffet style and as most other buffets I have been to, nothing much to write home about.The hotel is located inside a shopping mall so I guess the entrance can be hard to find if you do not know where you are going. Location in general is great with all major sites within walking distance (Not that there is that much to see in this small city...)We booked airport transfer through the hotel and while the pick up from the airport was on time and without any problems, the return was a different issue. We were suposed to be picked up at 5am, but at 5.25am we hade to get a taxi in order to catch our plane. The reception guy helped us with this.I wrote an e-mail to the transport company when I got back home and instantly got a nice replay saying that they deeply appologized and would offer us transportation for free on our next visit to Windhoek.We also tried the SPA at he hotel and it was wonderful. Unfortunately the pool was closed for repair of some sort so I can not comment on that.","Date of stay: March 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very good choice","Great central location. Attached to a mall with a supermarket, forex and a couple of cafes for drinks and snacks. Staff very friendly especially Ti'a on reception who was really helpful solving details on our reservation and getting our room ready early. Breakfast buffet had a good selection - hot, cold and cook to order items. Rate included dinner at the Pantry - good food, big portions, reasonable prices. Stayed twice at either end of our Namibia tour - the first time we had an upgraded Superior room and the second a standard Avani room. The Superior room was significantly bigger but both were clean and comfortable if a little dated. Free parking if you have a car which was easy to arrange and use. Drinks on the top floor are a must especially in the evening - great surround views. Also a small pool on the terrace which was a little cold. Easy walk to the main sites of interest. Also a gym on site which had some basis equipment. On our second visit we came from Omaruru - for anybody coming that way, stick on the C33 until the B2 as it is tarmac the whole way. Would stay here again.","Date of stay: March 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Never again!!! Lovely hotel TERRIBLE staff & service ","The hotel amenities are brilliant ... it's a pity the staff are just one BIG miserable bunch of human beings. They are just so miserable, like they are doing you a favour for just about anything. ""I'd like to check out""... got a glare & my key card yanked from my hand. ""Please can I order something to drink"", 3 people, 1 after the other glare at you like you've done something wrong, & then tell you, they'll send someone. We met 2 people that smiled & listened to an order. Never again!!!!Was part of a larger group of about 25 people,  it was the topic of conversation every morning & every evening, for the 2 days we were there.","Date of stay: December 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Avani","The ambiance and overall client service was great. Stayed there on the 3rd of March and the room needed some attention, but when I stayed there again on the 17th, in a different room it was flawless. The food is great and the service is excellent. They were accommodating in the sense to prepare breakfast packs as I had to checkout at 06h00 for an early flight. Great place and should keep up the good work. Just to get maintenance going on some of the rooms. I must say after the revamp the reception area is spectacular. Also just look at your loading zone. Its unsafe to load or offload in the main street. Other than that its a great place.","Date of stay: March 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Avani Windhoek","Avani Windhoek has finally been refurbished, the lifts are working, even the casino seems to have been upgraded a bit. Rooms are neat, sleep quality is good.

"Conference venue","Hotel well situated for business but meant that a number of delegates found it too easy to have to go back to office.  The actual room was stuffy and not cool enough.  The old-fashioned microphone-speaker system suffered from a bad 'overlay' of extraneous sounds, ranging from 'feedback whine' to 'distorted voice':  many speakers preferred to not use it!The hotel was undergoing 'renovations' that meant that not all facilities were available.The food was excellent and in a pleasant setting.The heat in Windhoek required the air-conditioner to be on all night.","Date of stay: November 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great place to stay ... if all the elevators are working...","A friend and I stayed here in April, for two nights, between safari trips. Staff very friendly, location great (right downtown) and breakfast buffet very good. I stayed in the same hotel four years or so ago, and the upgraded entrance is much, much better than having to get  there through a shopping mall. Rooms are very clean and well-appointed; bathrooms spacious and clean with shower and bath-tub.The main downside on this visit was that only one elevator of four was working. That meant loooooonnnnnggggg waits, to go up or down (ended up using the stairs to get down most of the time). When a big tour group was trying to leave the last morning we were there, it was a debacle trying to fight piles of luggage and frustrated guests.I would stay there again, but I would make sure the elevators were all working before I made a reservation. I would have rated this four circles, but the elevators resulted in a lower rating.","Date of stay: April 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disgrace to the country ","We stayed here after our flight was cancelled, the elevators were not working. The rooms are excellent but the restaurant is a disgrace to the country. Why try to mimic the show cooking you find everywhere if the country has so much to offer. The food was ok, but nothing more and the organization was terrible. An experience we could have missed in an otherwise wonderful country.","Date of stay: April 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ett hotell i centrum","Hotellet ligger i ett köpcentrum i de centrala delarna av Windhoek.Du checkar in på 2 våningen och du måste gå in i köpcentrumet för att ta dig dit.Hotellet är helt okej och ett av de bättre jag bott på i Namibia.När vi bodde där den första gången under resa så fungerade två av tre hissar. När vi kom dit andra gånger under resan så fungerade bara en. Det byggs en hel del runt hotellet. Men det var inget som störde mig eller de andra som jag resta med.Det finns bra mat på hotellet och du kan få mat från restaurangen eller från baren.Internet fungerar bra och det är lätt att koppla upp sig. Under kvällstid så är det inte säkert att gå runt själv ute. Vi var fyra och höll på att bli rånad under tidig kväll strax utanför hotellet. Men tack vare att en civilperson svängde in och skrämde de som försökte råna oss gick det bra. men det är inte hotellets fel. Där känns allt säkert.Det finns pool på taket där det finns solstolar och några bord. Vattnet är kallt. Jag har bott här förut och kommer säkert bo här igen.","Date of stay: November 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The food was really tasty but unfortunately there was a delegation and the restaurant was serving buffet whereby they cook the meat for you while you wait and that meant food service was super slow, However it was tasty.

"Only the location saves this over priced hotel","I got stuck and needed a place to sleep, so I stayed here. Read my other reviews, I try to find positives: this hotel is right in the city centre, so it is super easy to get around and great for a night or two. It seems good for business travellers, but I didn't find the quality equal to the excessive price. There is no water pressure. The lights have a strange on off system and in my room the exhaust fan in the bathroom went all night disturbing my sleep.  There is nothing in the mini bar, you can go downstairs to the bar, but nothing in the room. The quality of shampoo and conditioner is poor. WiFi drops out in the morning as people wake up: like most of the city yes. The breakfast has everything you want. The staff are lovely but impersonal. There is better value and better just out of the city centre if you have transport. Stay if you want the location.","Date of stay: April 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The roof top pool has little greenery and was even in hot November cold. I had a few problems, such as not working of the safe and the door that did not lock. Although it was solve within 30 to 60 minutes by very friendly staff, it is inconvenient, if you want to leave on time.

"Hotel per uomini d'affari cinesi...","L'hotel si trova all'interno di un centro commerciale sulla via principale di Windhoek, se si arriva di sera monta un po' di desolazione, soprattutto vista la quantità di guardie giurate che girano per i piani del centro con manganello in mano.Entrati nella hall tutto appare ben arredato e con l'aspetto del tipico albergo di grande città che basa la clientela più su viaggi d'affari che sul turismo.A destra dell'ingresso c'è un casinò con altre guardie con meta detector...Le camere sono molto ampie e spaziose, pulite e con bagno con sia doccia che vasca.Altra nota un po' dolente è la qualità del servizio sia del bar che del ristorante, i camerieri sono i più svogliati di tutta la Namibia e sembra ti facciano un favore a servirti un caffè...Considerato che per noi è stato il punto di partenza del viaggio giusto perché abbastanza vicino all'aeroporto si può anche soprassedere sul servizio...","Date of stay: August 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A good hotel with room for improvement","The hotel location is good and could not be more central to all business and other activities in Windhoek. With the hotel being part of the Sun chain of South African hotels it also comes with their standards - and with a casino. The room on the 5th floor was fine and rather spacious, all amenities were in good shape and the bedding was comfortable. The only downside is that you have to pay for internet access - they offer a number of access plans which are not too expensive, but still, other hotels in Namibia offer this for free. The internet speed was rather slow, despite the payment....never mind, I would have no hesitation to return to this hotel in future.","Date of stay: July 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great rooms, typical African lack of professionalism and service","Great rooms, mediocre food, check in took 40 minutes even though I am a regular stay member. Really dirty under beds, however rooms are great and hotel in general is ok, however some of the upperclass boutique hotels and guesthouses in Windhoek are probably much better value for money","Date of stay: February 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"buon hotel, scomodo raggiungerlo","l'hotel si trova nel centro della cittadina, e nel mezzo di un centro commerciale, per cui se non ti accorgi che nel corridoio di ingresso del centro commerciale  c'e'  un'entrata che ti porta direttamente  alla hall dell'hotel, ti devi trascinare su per 2 rampe di scale mobili le valigie, il che risulta abbastanza scomodo.Le stanze sono grandi, silenziose e pulite, il bagno ha doccia e vasca separati,il buffet ottimo e con ampia scelta e con prezzi contenuti, il caffe' migliore lo si beve al bar, quello del ristorante e' il caffe' americano messo nella tazzina da espresso, mentre al bar ci hanno servito un caffe' fatto con le cialde da bar. La piscina nel roof e' piccola e si vede che non e' molto frequentata , in quanto nell'acqua c'erano foglie e altro che galleggiavano, ho provato a entrarci , ma la temperatura dell'acqua non era gradevole.ho soggiornato per 2 notti nell'hotel in andata e in rientro da un soggiorno in un lodge park safari dell'interno,per cui tutto sommato, l'hotel va benissimo per questo tipo di soggiorno.","Date of stay: November 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very nice place!","We booked this only as a stop-over between traveling from Sossusvlei to Etosha and were pleasantly surprised. Great location – near everywhere we needed to be in Windhoek and we especially enjoyed the casino. Nice buffet – limited choice to what we came from at Sossusvlei Lodge, but acceptable. Staff were friendly and helpful with our early departure the next morning.","Date of stay: October 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Central Location, does what it says on the tin but not too much individual personality","I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in total on a visit to Namibia for work. After a long couple of flights it was great that the hotel was not more than 45 minutes from Windhoek airport. Great picture of The Queen and Prince of Edinburgh in the lobby who stayed there about 15 - 20 yrs ago. Got checked in efficiently. Good size rooms and cant complain at all. Its located on the central main street in Windhoek so there are restaurants on the same road in both directions. Atmosphere changes alot later on at night so my advice would be to eat relatively early. There was work on the hotel going on with some strange knocking sounds up to about 10pm that disturbed me a bit but then they stopped. OK breakfast - other reviews rave about it...Im not so thrilled, its a very average buffet in my opinion. Pool is basically a ""plunge pool"" on the small roof terrace but its nice to have the option for some fresh air. To sum-up - this hotel is basically a ""safe pair of hands"".... no individual personality but located centrally and close to the shops - you access the hotel through a shopping mall with a supermarket at the bottom level - so it is just very handy. I also felt very secure with lots of staff around in the lobby so that was an important plus.","Date of stay: November 2010This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

La chambre sans être merveilleuse est fonctionnelle, deux grands lits, une télé , un coffre fort une grande salle de bains. Seul gros problème le chauffage ne marchait pas et au mois de juillet il fait bien froid la nuit! Le Hall est beau et le petit casino attenant est sympathique.

"AMAZING STAY","This was my first time at Avani, it was amazing. The staff at Dunes restaurant are amazing. I was server regularly by alot of staff, but Michelle really stood out with her ever so friendly smile, profession pretty appearance and going the extra mile with all guests without discriminating-shes amazing. The stir fry station was a hit-the 2 chefs there delivered excellence.Room service was up to par, and the room quality and view was superb.On the downside, i had orders shouted at me from across the room by a receptionist and right begind me was a foreign couple and they were ushered to their seats while mine was pointed out to me from a distnace.But overall, thank you so much Avani for giving me a great 5 days stay in the heart of the city :)","Date of stay: August 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good location - Still more than reasonable","According to a recent reviewer we were to ""avoid at all costs"", so I was a little hesitant suggesting to a colleague that we stay at the hotel - but I had stayed here for 3 nights in October last year. Glad I decided to ignore the caution. Check-in was quick and smooth for both of us; small issue with room settled quickly. Rooms still very good.We did not have dinner in the hotel so cannot comment but visited restaurants  within walking distance from hotel for 3 dinners a short cab ride for the others.Breakfast still a very good selection - especially for variety of choice. Found most staff friendly and accommodating. Casino less noisy than previous time.PS. Well done to Namibia on winning COSAFA Cup - possibly the GM could have made more use of this event  in marketing to residents the respective evenings when Namibia were playing...?","Date of stay: May 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good, comfortable hotel which could be great with some minor changes","This is one of the best hotels in downtown Windhoek. We found the room to be large, clean and comfortable. We had two queen-sized beds with good, firm matresses. Wifi worked fine and had a decent speed. There is a parking lot in the same building, where customers can park for free (it is a shopping mall). The bathroom had a bathtub and a shower. Things to improve: there was no electric plug in the bathroom, nor a shaving/magnifying mirror. More plugs in the bedroom would also help.Overall,a very good option in Central Windhoek.","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Used to visit often","We were frequent visitors to this hotel for the past 17 years and it improved a lot over the years - especially aesthetically.  There service was never VERY great, but acceptable. We used to buy there Privileged Portfolio package on a yearly basis which gave us great discounts as Namibians, but since last year we were not contacted to join and started going to the Hilton instead. We tried to book there about 2 months ago but the prices were exuberant ! I would say they are over priced. There buffet is also very expensive in comparison to other hotels. They should make the variety less and decrease the price. Its not necessary to provide that big a variety and then have to charge that much. Breakfast is very expensive. You can get much better at many places all over Windhoek for less.  Overall the hotel is good, but we do not feel like going there anymore.","Date of stay: August 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not bad if you want to wake up at 06:00 the sounds of construction.","So all in all not bad. We arrived and we told they're overbooked. Unfortunately this process seems to grind to a halt as if they're waiting for someone to checkout hoping the problem solves itself. After around 45 minutes, I was told I had an upgrade so all appeared great. What they didn't tell me is outside of my widow is a construction site and they start piling and driving trucks at 6am. It's not a nice way to wake up and if only they told me, i wouldn't have leapt out of bed thinking we're under attack.","Date of stay: July 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Conveniently located","Good overall hotel conveniently located near the major (few) tourist attractions in Windhoek.We got a room on the 10th floor which had some view over the city (probably on the wrong side of the building since the best view was on the other side) but the room was clean and fairly large. We had dinner on the rooftop restaurant with an amazing view over the city and it was excellent. The service was good as well with an extremely friendly waitress.To mention also that the hotel organized for us the PCR test needed for our flight the next day.

Breakfast was the usual Sun International type of affair and was workmanlike. Staff appeared very disinterested though and not at all helpful.

She worked alone and there were a number of angry clients as the couldn't access their rooms coz they were still being cleaned at 5pm! Several of us had to wait for a long time to get clean rooms. There seems to be a serious shortage of man power and there was no sign of a manager or supervisor in charge of the hotel.  When I got to my room, I forgot about the waiting.  The room was very nice, comfortable, clean and beautiful. I enjoyed the night and didn't want to go out. I would stay again, anyway!","Date of stay: October 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Terrible experience","The worst hotel experience endured during our stay in Namibia. Arrival - difficult, rude, inefficient, unprofessional reception and other staff. We arrived later than we anticipated due to a flight delay, 7.45pm, with a booked arrival time of 4pm. We checked in only to be told ""we are full and busy"" and your room is not ready, ""ready in 10/15 mins"". So we waited just meters from reception counter which is also the entrance to the casino, where non hotel guests also roam around reception area drunk, loud and harassing guests as they enter the hotel entrance. We were never offered a glass of water, complimentary drink at the bar or the suggestion to dine in the restaurant while waiting for the room to be ""ready"". After 40 mins of waiting in reception, we approached the reception staff to say that this was really not good enough to wait this long for our room - it was now 8.30pm. The only remedy offered was a different room to that of which we booked - at no reduced rate. We thought this was unacceptable as we booked a luxury king room, they offered a standard twin bed room. The reception staff member was so rude and would not listen to our issue any further so he fetched for the duty manager who attended to our booking, apologizing for the inconvenience, and handing us a key card to the room. So we picked up and carried our own bags, finally found the lifts (if you have ever stayed here you know what we mean), reached the room which was nice, clean and spacious. After unpacking and showering we decided not to eat as it was so late, and have a nightcap from the mini bar instead. We couldn't open the fridge for love nor money, it looked locked. So we rang reception……waiting, waiting till it was answered and requested access to the minibar ""oh, you have to request it to be unlocked at reception"" was told to us.  Well that was never explained by the duty manager or other reception staff. So housekeeping arrived to the room and unlocked the minibar. Accommodation - large and spacious room (as we had booked a luxury king size room) comfy, nice linen, combined bath, shower, loo and vanity area, hair dryer, power points for recharging, desk area with chair, large flat screen TV, minibar (locked), coffee/tea facilities.Food - Dinner was offered somewhere in the hotel, but due to our debacle at reception we chose to not eat at all as it was so late. Breakfast buffet was included in room rate.  Selection and food quality was very good however sleepy bored staff tended to group together laughing and chatting until a supervisor walked past to break them up. The staff would remove your plates and glasses before you had finished with them. You had to keep saying ""no"" not finished. Minibar issue - at 7am the next morning, we had a knock at the door - it was a staff member wanting to check what we had consumed in the minbar last night! We were showering and dressing at this time, and he was lucky we were not asleep. Outrageous - they do not trust their guests and customers. We left the room at 8am and were chased by a staff member whilst the lift door was closing about the minibar again! Maybe the issue is they don't trust their own staff?Reservations - Book directly with hotel via website, using credit card.Facilities - Small bar near reception, Casino with poker machines.Best - clean rooms, old but well maintained, breakfast buffet (quality and selection of food).Comments - reception staff had an appalling attitude, casino vagrants sculling from wine bottles, drunk, in the reception area.Hint - for those choosing between the Kalahari Sands & Casino or the Hilton Hotel  - Hilton wins 2 hands down - price, location, facilities, food & staff. Stayed at both hotels during our Namibian trip. We also stayed at the Sun International, Sun Hotel in Gaborone with no issues at all.","Date of stay: June 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hotel im Einkaufszentrum mitten in Windhoek","Wir sind früh morgens in Windhoek gelandet und konnten unser Zimmer im 7. Stock schon um 10.00 Uhr morgens beziehen. Das Zimmer ist relativ gross, hatte zwei Doppelbetten und man hatte einen Blick auf die Stadt. Das Badezimmer war grosszügig und war für die dortigen Verhältnisse sauber. Das Zimmer müsste mal renoviert werden, die darüberliegenden Etagen wurden gerade renoviert (Baulärm von 9-17 Uhr).Das Hotel ansonsten scheint das beste zu sein, was Windhoek zur Zeit zu bieten hat, schräg gegenüber entsteht ein neues Hilton, dürfte in 3 Monaten fertig sein, scheint dann die bessere Wahl zu sein.

Essa é a minha quarta hospedagem a trabalho em Namibia, porem somos tratados como se nao conhesse, como primeira hospedagem....soa estranho. A comunicacao com os servicos nao é eficaz, apos a primeira noite ja queriam dar baixa pensando que iria fazer check out. Os servicos de limpeza e camareira ficou a desejar...solicitei bloco de notas para anotacoes, a resposta foi rapida nas palavras mas nao foi realizada...anteriormente ja tinha encima da cabeceira como em qualquer hotel deste nivel...","Date of stay: May 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Muito bem localizado","Hotel localizado na avenida principal de Windhoek, próximo de lojas, cafés e restaurantes. Quartos muito bons, boa casa de banho com banheira e duche separados. Espaços comuns agradáveis com o bar no terraço a ter uma vista óptima sobre a cidade. Pequenos almoços bastante variados. Limpeza irrepreensível e pessoal muito simpático e prestável. A piscina no terraço é muito pequena e fica no meio do bar sem espaço para espreguiçadeiras. Não utilizámos apesar do imenso calor. Recomendo o hotel.","Date of stay: March 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Improvement required","Having had a vehcile, the parking entrance into the mall was utterly not appealing. There was no one available to assist with our luggage from the car into the mall never mind the avail of trolleys.messy construction work also not appealing. The linen room attendance was dealt with animosity from the attenddee at the time and the breakfast needs a big revamp. This includes the utensils to display layout and variety of offering available. The bread was not fresh and the ""balcony"" area could do with some energy or life decor. The overall decor is bit dull and grey, no energy or life into the concept and the entrance/exit metal plates by the lifts on the room floors definitely not suited for hotels .","Date of stay: November 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Guter Standard aber nicht Gamechanging!","Dieses Hotel war die erste Unterkunft auf meine Namibiarundreise.Besonders gut war erstmal, dass man direkt in dem Gebäude in dem Parkhaus parken kann und nicht erst lange mit Koffern und Co rumlaufen muss.Am Abend warten Prostituierte vor dem Eingang des Parkhauses. Ich habe das nicht überprüft, aber es lag optisch sehr nahe.Das Frühstück hatte mich wirklich sehr begeistert.Optisch ist das Hotel und Zimmer eher normal.Der Rabatt, den die Portale ausweisen ist quatsch.

"Visita perfetta, con qualche intoppo","Hotel centralissimo, situato sulla rinomata Indipendent Avenue. Camere spaziose, pulite e dotate di comfort quali Wi-Fi gratuito e televisioni molto grandi. Staff di assoluta gentilezza ed educazione. Il ristorante  dell'albergo è discreto e, seppur a buffet, offre una varietà di carne e pesce cucinata al momento, su richiesta del cliente. Venendo alle note negative, bisogna assolutamente segnalare che il casinò assomiglia più ad una sala slot con pochi tavoli e sempre affollatissimi. Inoltre, al momento della mia visita, l'hotel era in ristrutturazione ma, a mio parere, questo non giustifica il fatto che tre ascensori su tre fossero fuori servizio, contemporaneamente, per una buona mezza giornata. Non è nemmeno giustificabile che, dentro al frigo-bar, ci fossero solo due misere bottigliette d'acqua (entrambe naturali), per il resto bisognava chiamare il servizio in camera. Hotel sicuramente consigliato, peccato solo per queste piccoli scivoloni del tutto inaspettati visto il livello della struttura.","Date of stay: August 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Bra centralt hotell i Windhoek","Bra och centralt hotell mitt i Windhoek. Bra rum som man förväntar av ett 4+ hotell. Fin utsikt över staden från rummet och ännu bättre från terassen på taket där poolen ligger. Mycket bra frukost, parkering i parkeringshus i anslutning till hotellet som var gratis för boende. Vi fick vår hyrbil levererad hit och det fungerade mycket bra med parkering, förvaring av bagage och att köra ut från Windhoek. Det finns ett shopping mall i anslutning till hotellet med mat supermarket och restauranger. Till och med ATM utanför dörren. Kändes ok att gå ute i Windhoek dagtid, men skulle aldrig ut och gå på kvällen.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comodo e centrale ","Siamo rimasti solo una notte e quindi il giudizio è parziale. Belle stanze, grandi e pulite. L'albergo, moderno e piuttosto anonimo,  è all'interno di un centro commerciale - chiuso la donenica - e quindi un po' poco romantico ma la posizione è comoda e centrale. Un problema sono certamente gli ascensori: nelle ore di punta bisogna fare lunghe attese e se si vogliono usare le scale queste sono poco segnalate. Buono e ampio il buffet per la cena  e abbondante la colazione.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Très bien situé et globalement très bien","Nous y avons séjourné une nuit lors de notre circuit Namibien.L'accueil est tout à fait correct. Les chambres sont spacieuses, de qualité équipées d'un frigo, climatisées et la literie excellente.Pour ce qui concerne la restauration, petit bémol, service en Buffet, assez moyen, en tout cas ce soir là. Le service est un peu moyen lui aussi. Par contre le petit déjeuner était très bien, varié, à l'anglaise, à la française, au choix voire complet en choisissant les deux. En Buffet lui aussi proposant des fruits frais excellents.Nous avons trouvé un hôtel calme la nuit et le problème vient de l'utilisation des ascenseurs.

"Newish...","I stayed at the Kalahari Sands Hotel a few years ago and remember it being rather dated, smelly and the elevators were built by Otis himself.The Avani, on the other hand, is none of those things - except perhaps the slow elevators. The room was modern, comfortable and well appointed and the buffet at the hotel restaurant was pleasant.I'd definitely go back.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Gutes Hotel für einen kurzen Aufenthalt","Wir waren die ersten Tage unseres Aufenthalts in Namibia im AVANI. Der Check-In lief ein wenig holprig, was aber größtenteils daran lag dass etwas mit der Buchung über einen Drittanbieter falschgelaufen ist. Es waren alle sehr bemüht um uns und wir hatten relativ schnell unser Zimmer. Die Zimmer sind wie schon von anderen gesagt immer sauber und sehr großzügig geschnitten. Windhoek ist nicht sonderlich belebt und deshalb war unser Zimmer auch schön ruhig. Der Pool auf dem Dach existiert, ist aber nicht zu benutzen. Er ist schlichtweg zu kalt und man hat nach wenigen Sekunden kein Gefühl in den Füßen.","Date of stay: August 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Früher Kalahari Sands","Leider Haben Die neuen Eigentümer den Namen geändert(müssen?). Der neue Name ist nichtssagend.Wir mögen das Hotel, da die Zimmer grosszügig und modern ausgelegt sind.

Die Lage ist Ausgezeichnet im ""Laufabstand"" zu vielen Geschäften und Sehenswürdigkeiten. Nachteil ""der Haupteingang"". Vor dem Hotel kann man nicht parken, es gibt kein ""sichtbares"" Hotelersonal um den Gästen aus dem Taxi bzw. dem Auto zu helfen. Es gibt keine ""Hotelvorfahrt"" wenn man mit dem eigenen Auto kommt, muss man wissen das man auf eine Paralellstrasse(Rückgebäude) fahren muss um auf die Parkplätze des Hotels im ca. 6.

A bit of a delay checking-in as only one person on duty at reception but nothing too trying. I popped into the casino for a bit. Usual assortment of mainly oriental gamblers. I felt comfortable at the blackjack table and it was friendly enough.

So it is easy to walk, shop,etc. Lots of construction made accessing some of the governmental buildings a challenge. The hotel itself is nice enough. Rooms are decent sized. Bathroom is large but shower is a bit tight. Had breakfast and dinner in the restaurant. Buffet was disappointing and rather expensive. The ownership change (from Kalahari Sands to Avani) happened during our stay.  The new owners held a rather loud celebration the second night of our stay which we could hear in our room on the 8th floor. Not a good introduction to the new ownership.","Date of stay: June 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very good long stay!","Let me start by saying that I stayed at the Kalahari Sands for over 2 months, so my impressions are not those of the casual passer-by. I can't find a fault with this hotel. The rooms are very nice and spacious. The housekeeping is simply perfect and there is never a missing amenity or anything to complain about. The housekeeping staff are also very nice and will always greet you with a smile (as opposed to those at Reception). The turn-down service with the chocolate is a very nice detail. I can't say much about the restaurant or the bar because I didn't go there often. The breakfast was very good and varied. They serve a buffet for lunch and dinner, the main reason why I didn't go there for my meals, but I assume those who do like buffets would find it very good, as they serve very fresh products and of good quality. The swimming pool is on the terrace and it's rather small. It does get windy up there so it's not always comfortable. It's the one place of the hotel which seems to be left to be a bit neglected. If you want service up there, you have to call downstairs so it's a bit odd. The bar has live music on Friday evenings, not sure about Saturdays.The spa is really nice but book in advance because it can get very busy, especially on Friday afternoon and Saturdays. The gym is not inside the hotel but in the shopping center downstairs. Ask at reception and they'll give you a day pass and direct you to it. It's great for a cardio work-out but very weak on weight training. I found only 1-2 kg free weights and a 10kg bar. There are some machines for the lower body and they were adding some for the upper body. If you go after 5.15pm you'll face the crowds and will have to fight for space. Good thing is it's open from 5am to 10pm and is also open on Saturdays and Sundays almost all day. I can't say anything about the casino because I never went in there. The location of the hotel is also very good, in the downtown, close to restaurants and shops. Apart from the shopping center downstairs, which is very convenient, there is also another shopping center/mall a couple of blocks away.I would definitely recommend the hotel and would go back there without hesitating. Don't let yourself be badly impressed by the receptionists; after all, you'll only see them twice during your stay.","Date of stay: January 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"very comfortable, let down by smoking in the foyer","I loved my room which was spacious, clean and comfortable. I was on the 14th floor and had a wonderful view of windhoek! The breakfast buffet had really good variety all throughout my stay and i found the staff friendly. The location is superb, right in the heart of windhoek. Here's the problem: smoking is permitted in the lobby. I mean this is a public (and enclosed) area! It was a most unpleasant experience to be assailed by second hand smoke during check in.

"The best times are over ...","The hotel is situated in the middle of the city center on top of a shopping mall. This is supposed to be one of the top hotels in Windhoek. Maybe it was some time ago.The staff is very helpfull and professional. Rooms are not very nice (interieur, colors) and look a little bit used. You have to wait ages for an elevator. The inhouse restaurant offers buffets, but there are definetly cheaper and better places to go for lunch or dinner. I guess that the only reason for this place being popular is the casino.","Date of stay: December 2009This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Es war zum Glück nur eine Nacht","In diesem Hotel hat uns nichts gefallen ausser der Lage.Bereits die Ankunft mit dem Auto ist unschön - das Parkhaus ist dunkel und wenn man  Sonntag am frühen Nachmittag ankommt schleppt man seine Koffer ewig weit über Treppen durch ein leeres Einkaufszentrum - einen Wagen zum Koffertransport gibt es nicht. (Falls es einen Weg ohne Treppen gab, war der nicht ausgeschildert und der Parkplatzwächter des Hotels war nicht zuständig).Check-in dauert lange - obwohl alles leer ist.  Man sollte sich bereits dort den Schlüssel für die Minibar/Kühlschrank geben lassen, die ist sonst abgeschlossen und es dauert lange, bis jemand mit einem Schlüssel kommt. Die Zimmer sind renovierungsbedürftig und wirken leicht angeschmuddelt und düster. Sie waren allerdings sauber und ausreichend groß. Eine kaputte Glühbirne am Nachttisch am Sonntag zu wechseln war ausserhalb der Möglichkeiten des Hotels.Was sonst noch nicht funktioniert hat: -Telefon (leider die gesamte Anlage ausgefallen, so dass man nicht nach draußen telefonieren konnte, aber am Sonntag ist halt nichts zu machen), -der Weckruf (kam eine halbe Stunde zu spät - das kann nicht am Sonntag gelegen haben, inzwischen war Montag) -Frühstück aufs Zimmer (war bestellt, kam nicht - aber es ist schließlich am Tag nach Sonntag. Es kam dann nach vielem Telefonieren ein Kaffee, aber der war vermutlich vom Vortag, lauwarm, abgestanden und gallebitter)-Fahrstühle (wir haben zum Glück im 4. Stock gewohnt, so dass wir statt 10 Minuten pro Weg zu warten, lieber Treppen gestiegen sind.Was uns am Hotel gefallen hat - es liegt sehr zentral. Man kann die meisten Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuss erreichen (Post Street, Alte Feste, Christus Kirche, Parlament, Tintenpalast). Im Cafe am Zoo schräg gegenüber kann man auch am Sonntag gut und in schöner Atmosphäre essen - allerdings nur bis 20.00 Uhr. Am Hotel selber hat uns nichts gefallen - wir würden sicher nicht noch einmal dort bleiben.","Date of stay: September 2009This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"An OK Place to stay","This hotel is an OK place to start or finish your tour of Namibia, but it is definitely for passing through.It's a typical 'corporate' hotel which, once you're inside could be anywhere. Having said that it does its job pretty well, being in the town centre and OK for the airport.When we were there 2 out of 3 lifts were working, the third was in the process of being replaced and lokked like it should be finished soon, but there was no problem.Everything was fine without being outstanding.If you want a nice meal try the Zoo Gardens Restaurant in the park just down the street.The casino is not really 'in your' face' - it's there if you want it","Date of stay: April 2008This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Avani Hotel-Pleasant Stay/Positive Experience","All my previous business trips to Windhoek, I stayed at the Hilton Windhoek hotel(twice). My third business trip I stayed at the Avani hotel, I had a pleasant stay and a positive experience about the hotel and the employees. The Avani rooms and bed sizes are very nice and comfortable , and the bathrooms are also very nice and the come with privacy compared to the Hilton Windhoek hotel’s bathrooms. The staff at the Avani Dunes Restaurant especially Christy, Zudre, and Ziggy are very kind, welcoming, and attentive to guests. I will definitely consider the Avani hotel again for my next business. Although the brand name Avani may not be as popular as other chain hotels, I would consider it a hidden nice and comfortable  hotel with the same amenities you would expect from other well known hotel brand names in Windhoek. Give it a try, and you may be pleasantly surprised especially if you stayed in other hotels during your previous trips to Windhoek.","Date of stay: February 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Central and comfortable ","Check in was easy even though busy due to cancelled flights out of Windhoek. Very central with access to a mall.Stayed on the top floor on  a Saturday night, avoid the top floors as the music blasts out from mid afternoon to close to midnight from the Bar on the roof. Room was comfortable enough but couldn't rest until late in to the night. Dune Restaurant was closed so had to eat in the pub restaurant by the reception, choose and food was okay, nothing special. During the weekend the hotel might have a different vibe and be a little more quieter during the week.","Date of stay: August 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A promising hotel in Windhoek","Avani Windhoek is still undergoing renovations and facelift as at December 26th 2019 when I visited . The reception area and rooms have been redone, and are in great shape.The presidential site is spacious and tastefully designed. Done defects with plumbing works but these should be easily corrected. It's best bargain and value for family. The restaurant is still in a bad state, the furniture there is old and rugged , ambience and lighting are poor. I acknowledge though the renovations were still ongoing,do this review may not accurately paint the right picture after say six months after its publication. Service and good at the were good.

Am nächsten Morgen um 8 Uhr (ich lag noch im Bett), klopfte jemand an unserer Türe. Der Herr wollte die Minibar checken, was wir getrunken hätten?? Das habe ich also noch nie im Leben erwähnt.

"New rooftop pool and sun deck","For any families or person that might book this hotel for its pool and sun deck, forget it.  Don’t bother. Whilst it has uninterrupted views across the city the actual pool is nothing more than a plunge pool. If you wish to lay in the sun you’ll be nothing more than a metre away from someone eating or drinking. This is the worst design for a pool deck I have ever seen. There is no privacy whatsoever and I doubt any bikini clad lady would want to sunbathe next to an inebriated businessman gawping at her.","Date of stay: March 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Waiting for the lifts","Nobody had adviced me when booking the hotel they were going under renovations. The system that manages the lifts do it separately so while you stand there thinking the lift is coming, it’s not until another person comes and knowing the system, shows you what to do, you stand there forever. Even knowing it can keep you waiting up to 10 minutes at breakfast times. Even so, the service is excellent and with the exception of being told about the lift, I felt welcome, and have to acknowledge the attention to detail. And the great view. So far the best hotel I stayed in in Windhoek!","Date of stay: July 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Need an upgrade","Stayed three nights earlier this month. Good service. However, be aware that they only accept laundry for same day delivery. This means that you will have to get up before 8 am on Saturday to deliver laundry as they deny to collect it the evening before. Nice breakfast buffet. Only buffet dinner available, no a la carte. Generally the hotel is in a need for an upgrade especially if you compare to Hilton where we poped in for a dinner. One of the elevators are in urgent need for service as the noise might keep you awake during the night if you don't use earplugs.

"Why stay at the Hilton when you can stay here?","It is about four years since I stayed in Kalahari Sands and in that time it has been completely renovated. The rooms are very clean, the beds very comfortable, the linen pristine.  The staff and service is very friendly.The breakfast at Kalahari is world class and the range of food is excellent. You even get a morning paper. I am having withdrawal symptoms now I am home because I will not see a breakfast like that for a while!Kalahari is central in Windhoek with excellent shopping facilities. There is hotel parking and there is free access to a gym a very short walk from the hotel. There is also a pool area on the roof where you can lie in the sun but don’t forget that at 1600m above sea level you will burn quite quickly.WiFi is available at small charge (it works well) and the bedrooms have a range of power sockets that will cater for all charger connectors. There is also a good business centre where you can print documents.Kalahari Sands is excellent value for money and an excellent base from which to explore Namibia.If you want an airport transfer or tour of the city, contact Michael on  00264812368666. He is a very good driver.","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Unremarkable","A common dilemma I presume is choosing between the Hilton and this hotel. I enjoy a bit of fun at the slot machines and there fore it became the automatic choice. Booked two rooms for one night at just over R1800 each which brings it very close to the more upmarket Hilton. The rooms had a dreadful view up the back end of another building. Quite small room. Nice big TV. Beds of average comfort. Clean all round. Worn towels. Check in was a long laborious process. No greetings or smiles. No one to assist with luggage. Bar staff friendly and helpful and good atmosphere and a few laughs at the immaculately dressed hookers milling around. Internet is not free. Had a breakfast pack prepared because of early departure - don't bother - you will likely choke on the stale and dry sandwiches. It will have to be the Hilton next time - it's in walking distance to the casino anyway.","Date of stay: October 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Location is very good.The problem was that there was no hot water in the hotel for day and a half out of the 3 days we stayed there. We were told about the problem only after we checked in and were on our way to our rooms (a very long process as always in Africa). A cold shower after 28 hours on the way is not something that you wish for. By the way, they didn't offer any discount or compensation for this inconvenience.","Date of stay: December 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This was the first time we as a family decided to deviate from the traditional home cooked Christmas lunch and opted to eat out for Christmas Lunch.  We were not disappointed with our decision.  The buffet was exceptional! The food was fresh and it was tasty.  The variety of dishes were so many it was difficult to decide what to eat and what not.  The best part of the experience for our family was the seafood, there was also crayfish, yummy, that was freshly prepared.  Also a first for our family, to eat mostly seafood for Christmas Lunch. Lol! The dessert section also did not disappoint, with a selection of cakes, fresh fruit and ice cream.The service was great, all the staff was very attentive and quick.The entire experience was amazing, and it was great value for money.We look forward to the next Christmas Buffet Lunch, as we will definitely be makin this a new family tradition.","Date of stay: December 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Quite okay - with rather weak service","The hotel is in a good location and the facilities are actually still fairly new and OK. The view from the rooftop bar is great, the rooms are fine. However, the overall organization of the staff clearly needs improvement.

The carpets are old and dirty and have a bad smell esp the 9th floor where I stayed. They could do with a revamp and maybe consider laminate flooring considering the traffic of guests they have. I experienced a noice issue on Saturday the 19th with loud music coming from their 15th floor sky bar, until after 1am and was told its a private party there is nothing that can be done about it, which I found to be unfair.","Date of stay: October 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Unrestful and unpleasant","I stayed here for eight days on business.I will just give a statement of some factually true things which were in place whilst I was there without any comments....maybe some people would enjoy this sort of place...Building works are ongoing. There is one lift for the guests but they are allowed to go in the dirty staff lift which, after waiting for a lift for almost ten minutes, is what you have to do.The swimming pool is closed. There is nowhere at all to sit outside. When I asked, they offered to put a chair in the car park for me.On Saturdays and Fridays there is desperately poor quality, loud music in the Pantry - the only place to get something to eat unless you want a huge buffet blow out. I had to resort to room service on those two nights. I had to go to reception to order my room service as the phone was broken.The service, especially from the the meet and greet ladies at breakfast, is slow and not polite, in most cases. There are a couple of waiters/ waitresses who do their jobs fantastically, but they are the exception rather than the rule.The rooms are generally clean.Building noise started before 8am and finished after 8pm on some days.When I asked for help booking a tour on my day off, I was given a leaflet and told to book it online. Some of the reception staff are very helpful.","Date of stay: October 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Hilfe vom Hotel sucht man vergebens.Auch Kompensationsleistungen für all die Abstriche sind nicht freiwillig zu erwarten.Nachdem man sich massiv beschwert hatte, wurden einem Freigetränke an der Bar ausgegeben.Alles in allem nicht hinnehmbar, das Hotel in diesem Zustand weiterhn geöffnet zu lassen und dies auch noch zu diesen Preisen...Zimmer sind dafür geräumig und sauber.","Date of stay: December 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Back for a second time. ","Came here previously before the renovations. Friendly front desk staff. Room service prompt and good quality. As they are still renovating the hotel is not fully operational but that does not stop one from having a good nights sleep. Beds are good. Bathrooms are clean and serviced daily. Although we were there for a few hours only we had a good rest and thus could attend to business refreshed. Wi-Fi was good. Left before breakfast unfortunately but next time. Only down side no assurance with bags. But we were traveling light and it was late. So they get away with one.

"Zentrales Stadthotel dem einiges fehlt....","Zimmer sind groß und gepflegt, wie man sie in einem Hotel dieser Preisklasse erwarten kann. Ebenso das Frühstück. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit !!!Der Pool und Aufenthaltsbereich auf dem Dach sind sehr ungepflegt- die Aussicht nur durch Fenster in Kniehöhe zu ""genießen"". Der Speisesaal ist mit Gipsplatten abgetrennt, welche mit Postern und Heftzwecken verziert sind. Das Hotel liegt über einer Einkaufspassage- die hinabführende Rolltreppe war mindestens 5 Wochen defekt.Von den 3 hoteleigenen Aufzügen war abwechselnd immer nur einer in Betrieb, und der gab wenig vertrauenserweckende Geräusche von sich. Am Abflugtag haben wir vorsichtshalber das Treppenhaus genommen, das dem eines alten Parkhauses ähnelt- ist wahrscheinlich nur als Notausstieg gedacht.....","Date of stay: December 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ottima posizione centrale","Abbiamo soggiornato due notti in questo bell'albergo, moderno e in posizione centrale all'inizio del nostro tour in Namibia.L'albergo è situato all'interno di un centro commerciale, che purtroppo, durate il weekend, è sempre chiuso. Camera spaziosa all'undicesimo piano. Bagno grande e pulito. Ottimo Wi-fi in camera. Personale gentile e accogliente alla reception. Unico punto negativo la lentezza degli ascensori e il loro cattivo funzionamento che obbligano a lunghe attese al piano. Ottimo il buffet della prima colazione ricco di frutta esotica.Rapporto qualità-prezzo adeguato. Raccomandabile.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Easy access into town","Located, in the heart of the city, it doesn't get anymore central than this. Food is decent, albeit a tad bit expensive, unsustainable over a long stay. Rooms quite nice,but staff's service levels could be greatly improved. This hotel has a great name, and international reputation, to say the services offered match such an image would be slightly stretching the bounds of truth. No shuttle","Date of stay: February 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good location and good value.","I stayed for two nights on a business trip.  The hotel is located in the middle of Windhoek CBD, opposite the FNB and RMB bank building, with all shopping amenities within walking distance.  Parking is provided as part of the shopping center's parking with access from the back of the hotel (western side,  Werner List Street).  The hotel access is not on street level but on the second floor of the shopping center.  Do not be too worried about the slightly warn nature of the shopping center as it is not indicative of the hotel itself.  There is a Foreign Exchange literally 5 yards from the hotel entrance!  The staff was friendly with no hick-ups when booking in.  I stayed on the 9th floor in a standard room which is very spacious and well appointed.  Bedding on the king size bed was of a high quality.  A kettle with tea and coffee was provided.  The bathroom is clean and has a shower as well as a bath tub. There is also a mini fridge in the room.  The room surprisingly quiet given the location of the hotel.  The views from the upper floors of the hotel is great.  The television in the room is bigger that what you would usually get in hotels, with a choice of sport, news and movie channels, mainly sourced from DSTV form South Africa. WIFI is strong enough to make Whatsapp calls.Breakfast was fairly standard, but did provide a fair choice of  traditional and continental options.  I suggest (weather permitting) that you take breakfast outside on the terrace looking out over Independence avenue to feel the Windhoek vibe.  Despite the construction currently underway across the road, it is still the best way to have breakfast.Check out was fast and very efficient.  Just remember to have your parking ticket validated at reception before you leave.","Date of stay: June 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Angenehm in Windhoeks Mitte","Sehr angenehmes Zimmer, frühes Frühstück sehr reichhaltig und abwechslungsreich. Allerdings fehlte mal der Toaster, dann ein Messer bei der Käseplatte... Internetanbindung katastrophal schlecht (selbst wenn ""Verbindung hervorragend"" angezeigt wurde, ungenügende Versorgung). Zimmersafe fehlte in meinem Zimmer. Turndown Service unregelmäßig. Dass es innerhalb einer nicht gelang, die Rolltreppe abwärts von der Lobbyebene zur Eingangsebene zu reparieren, gibt kein gutes Bild.

"Perfect location, best breakfast, friendly staff","I have stayed many times in Avani, Windhoek for business and pleasure- central in the main street within walking distance of shops and city attractions. I regard their breakfast buffet as the best in town (I have stayed in many hotels in Windhoek). Rooms are spacious with a view over Windhoek - from any room. Beds big and comfortable. I like their  decor - desert theme artworks. Staff go the extra mile! Quality shops in the same building as the hotel - shoes, clothing, etc. Parking good and accessible. Great conference rooms. Swimming pool on roof with a nice view over Windhoek. Getting even better very time because management implements renovations. I hear a great new entrance is forthcoming. Close to Head-offices af many local businesses.","Date of stay: January 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Der Service hat nachgelassen","Der Service beim Personal im Restaurant hat nachgelassen. Einzig die Angestellten am Empfang sind noch relativ freundlich und hilfsbereit. Wenn man im Restaurant am Tisch sitzt, laufen mehrere Angestellte am Tisch vorbei aber keiner fragt ob man schon bedient sei. Ich musste praktisch jedes mal die Angestellten darum bitten mir etwas zu trinken zu bringen. Das Abendbuffet ist praktisch jeden Abend das selbe. Es gibt keine Abwechslung. Die Zimmer sind immer noch gross und hell. Doch sollte das ganze Gebäude mehr in Stand gehalten werden. Die Wand im Bad hatte Risse und die Badewanne war zerkratzt. Die Rolltreppe vom Hotel in die Etage im unteren Stock war schon das letzte Jahr defekt. Jetzt war sie wieder defekt und zwar im August und im September. Es ist sehr unangenehm mit 2 schweren Koffern eine defekte Rolltreppe hinunter zu laufen.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Event/seminar room booking is unorganised","I booked one the hotel rooms to hold training on the 18th June with my employees. I handed over all the necessary signed documents on the 10th June to the lady who deals with these types of booking. The lady confirmed that everything was fine and showed me the room where our training will take place. We arrived on the training day at 8am as planned, but we were told nothing was booked for us, the training room showed to us was locked and no one seems to know anything about it.  We were told that the lady who deals with event booking does not work on Saturday and when the duty manager called her she said she did not book the room because she did not receive the signed document from us, which is a big lie. We were all surprised because my two colleagues and I deliver all the signed documents in person a week earlier to this lady.  The signed documents gave the hotel authority to take a payment from us which they have done, although they have not booked the room. We ended up starting our training after 9am instead of 8am as planned. They are unreliable, unorganised and liars. So think twice before you book their event rooms","Date of stay: June 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It is a fitting and comfortable business hotel.

"My suggestion is to choose Hilton instead","I can not recommend this hotel. Although sunday and the hotel was almost empty they gave us the worst rooms. The rooms were on the lowest floor and in front of the windows we had a wall full of air con compressors making a lot of noise 24/24. In front of the door there was the service entrance of the staff. The T.V was not working, the telephone was not working the air con was not working ( we changed the batteries and resolved ourselves). Wi Fi connection for free but was very badIn the other room the T.V was not working either. The rooms are a bit run down.We went to Hilton just across the road for dinner and if returning to Windhoek we will for sure choose the Hilton.","Date of stay: November 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It will do","This hotel has a very nice finish, the bedrooms are nice and the bathrooms are wonderful. Larger than normal TV and nice finishes all round, however where it fails for me is the restaurant and service, mainly the food got me down a lot. After visiting the Lesotho version of these hotels I have to say I expected more, rightfully it did deliver in the room department, neater and more up to class. However it failed with food, the food doesn't have taste, doesn't feel like you eating at a place that looks so nice, real shame as Lesotho wasn't as nice however the food was above standard. Desert was the worst, I ate three different kinds and none tasted any different. The options is more limited than one would like and the service is ok, people are friendly to a degree however not nearly like they want to be friendly. Front desk was good however, sadly that wasn't the only true highlight during the stay. Lucky the hotel is within a mall, so other food options are close. Another let down was the pool area, it's located on the roof however any option of a way is let down by the fact it's walled up and you can only see out the Windows at knee height, otherwise it's just walls. All in all, I would say it's a good place for quick stop over or business trips, however not something special.","Date of stay: September 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Never again!","We booked for 2 nights but only stayed 1 due to the noise from a nightclub which prevented us sleeping until around 4am. The staff in the bar area were less than happy in their jobs which showed in the lack of customer service, also the bar appeared to be  frequented by some ladies of the night! The reception staff were lovely and in fairness did offer to move us to a different room which we declined and re booked for the Hilton for our remaining night in Namibia.","Date of stay: May 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Average...","Like my title says, the hotel was average. Pleasant bed, acceptable standard of cleanliness with the exception of the bath which was not particularly inviting. Staff were quite nice and did their best to answer questions & address concerns. My standout for this hotel was the room service, my burger was utterly delicious, great and grilled to perfection with crispy fries. My compliments to the chef! The absence of the salad I initially requested though due to 'the avocado not being ready' took me aback somewhat though given the considerable size of the hotel. Multi- plug wall fittings were present (a personal favourite touch I always appreciate as a business traveller). However there was no complimentary internet access. Indeed one cannot even enter their room details and name on the hotel site from their room but must instead head to the business centre to purchase a hard copy voucher (which incidentally barely lasted an hour). I see a need to step into the future at least on that score if they are not prepared to provide complimentary wifi (at $250 per night, I really can't see why not). Great TV channels though with up to date movies. The provision of breakfast boxes for very early departures was appreciated. I should also point out that the hotel is located within a mall so you shopaholics will love that! It's a good location from which to do a spot of sightseeing. I didn't have time to pop by the casino so I'm afraid those with the gambling bug won't get anything from me on that score. Overall, a nice enough hotel if you're passing through. Give it a go.","Date of stay: August 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Do not visit the Bar/Restaurant","... I just know from my friends the rooms are now renovated and look much better (Hilton is now on the other side of the street), but today I had dinner in their restaurant (buffet) which was between ok to bad (fish totally salty, most of the meat tasteless and poor quality).But the cream on the top was the bar. Sorry, but the way they serve there (time, attitude, friendliness) is not acceptable. Also I would expect in a hotel like this, that the staff at least speaks English on a Thai Bar Lady level. Also if you order rum without ice and then you have to watch them how they remove the ice (because of their own miscommunication) by using 3(!) glasses, the the only positive thing I can say is,that luckily they did not do with their fingers.When I was already out of the bar and my friends complained that their attitude is not ok, the answer was ""You do not come to my country and tell me ...."" But half of them hold Namibian passports ...Sorry, there are other places where you can spend your money.If you have no clue, you could at least be friendly.","Date of stay: January 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"its a very good value for the money","We got a very good rate when we stayed at the Kalahari Sands. You will not have a better value for money in town. Rooms are very modern and well equipped; above all spacious. Food choice including the room service is poor, so you will be better off eating out.

The hotel staff have hit me up for money (which I expect on the street, not inside the hotel) and prostitutes proposition in the lobby. Service is variable and indifferent. Expect to be wokrn up at all hours by loud voices and drunken, seedy clientele. Do yourself a favour and go to some of the privately run (with German efficiency and cleanliness) smaller hotels and guest houses in Windhoek and give the Sands a miss.","Date of stay: December 2007This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Excellent","Friendly and welcoming Service from Hotel personnel.  I would prefer different type of coffee.  The cleaning staff opened the door on sunday, felt they invaded my privacy.  I would suggest them not to open the door when ever they want.  Or receptionist should tell guests before checking in about the time they will come for cleaning.","Date of stay: February 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great stay in Windhoek","The customer service at this hotel is fantastic.  I would like to acknowledge the service we received from Sylvester.   He did a great job of checking us into the hotel and providing us with any information we required.  The hotel is adjacent to a shopping mall which is great if you forgot something at home or just wanted to browse for a souvenirs.  There is also an adjacent coffee shop (Seattle Coffee Company) which had delicious coffee.  It is in a great location across the street from a market and close to the Supreme Court.  There are several options for meals available.  We had dinner on the patio overlooking Windhoek.The food was ok (the appetizers and sundowners were a highlight for us).   My girls were excited to use the pool, but be warned it is actually in the middle of the rooftop bar, so it is kind of awkward to use.  The rooms were average (North America standard) but the bathrooms were beautiful.  Our shower had great pressure with warm water. The beds and pillows were comfortable. The air conditioner in both of our rooms was not working (but that was ok as it was not very warm while we were there)There are plenty of television channel options and the wifi is fast.","Date of stay: October 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Slightly surreal but a Good location","Great location.  The hotel is located in a shopping center.  Lobby has a small casino.  We had the deluxe room which faced the Supreme Court Building and was very roomy.  The decor is dated.  We stayed for two nights when we arrived in Namibia and one night as a stop over on our way to the desert.  Some of the staff remembered us.  Overall it's a decent hotel but it's slightly overpriced and there is just something very surreal about it - in a good way.Be forewarned that downtown shutdowns after 1pm on Saturday until Monday morning.  It's a good time to go out to Panduka and support the folks in townships.","Date of stay: March 2007This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Clean and convenient, but not for someone who likes to breathe!","The Kalahari Sands is in the centre of town, and convenient, but particularly ""airless"". The windows in the rooms are locked (no jumpers, allowed!), so I assumed the pool deck (on the 15th floor) would be a good bet to breathe the evening air…Well, the pool deck is a huge disappointment, cramped, walled in and - you guessed it - a smokers refuge! Disappointing that there is nowhere in the hotel where one can enjoy the balmy Windhoek air on a summers'  evening.  On the whole, the rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff friendly. The automatic power-save mechanism is a bit quirky  though - by day 3 I had discovered that the only way to get the hairdryer to work, was to exit the room (with wet hair) and in so doing reset the power, before the hairdryer worked…!","Date of stay: February 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very good hotel in the heart of Windhoek","Very good hotel in the heart of Windhoek. The entrance in the middle of a small shopping center may be located a bit “unconventional” but once in the hotel, we had a wonderful time. Rooms are big, clean and fully equipped. An oasis in the Namibian capital. Service is very attentive and the staff is working hard to make your stay pleasant one. Breakfast buffet fits in this overall positive impression. Definitely recommended.","Date of stay: February 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great service during a difficult time for us","My wife and I were booked into the Kalahari Sands Hotel on Oct 28  for one night at the end of our Namibia holiday. That one night turned into four nights because of the closing of JFK following Hurricane Sandy. Despite being very full, the staff went out of their way to make us welcome and very comfortable as we dealt with the uncertainty of when we would be able to go home. On the front desk Therresa Rudifo deserves special mention. She was great, upgrading our room at no additional charge and securing it every day as we waited until 3:00 pm to hear if we were going or staying. The bellman hauled our bags up and down four times with a great sense of humor, keeping us calm during a time of stress. When we thanked a member of the room cleaning staff for a service, she very graciuosly said ""It is no problem. You are my guests."" sounding like it was her hotel not like an employee. We were touched and impressed.About the hotel in general, we found the rooms very comfortable. Breakfast, which is included in the rate, and the lunch and dinner buffets, are very good with a lot of variety of choices. At first we found the hotel's entrance on the second floor of a shopping arcade a little odd, but it turned out to be very convenient, with a restaurant, coffee shop, supermarket, pharmacy, and many interesting shops right outside our door. There are also two excellent restaurants within a block of the hotel.We went out every morning at 6:00 am for exercise and always felt very safe in the neighbor. The hotel is right in the heart of downtown Windhoek which we got to know very well on our extended stay. We would have two suggestions for improvement. Because the casino and the lounge are just off the lobby, the smell of cigarette smoke is very strong there. This was not an issue in the rooms. Since smoking seems to be more common in Namibia than the US, I don't know what the solution might be; but the air quality in the lobby is challenging for non-smokers. Second, the coffee and tea service was very slow at breakfast, despite the appearance of adequate staff. Why not put a coffee and tea service station out where quests can serve themselves if they choose to. It's already a buffet. What's one more station? Service at lunch and dinner was much more responsive, so we don't know what might cause this issue at breakfast. But the solution of an extra station seems like an easy fix.To the staff of the Kalahari Sands Hotel, thank you for making us feel welcome and well looked after during a time if stress and uncertainty. We will be back and we will recommend your hotel to our friends.","Date of stay: October 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Zentral gelegen, guter Standard","Von hier aus haben wir Windhoek erobert. Das Hotel liegt mitten in der Stadt an der Hauptstrasse in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft von guten Geschäften und einem Supermarkt direkt im Hause. Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten ließen ohne Probleme zu Fuss erreichen.Achtung: Plötzlich um 17 Uhr Ortszeit schließen die Geschäften und die Strassen leeren sich bltzschnell. Auch wenn wir keine Kriminalität erlebt haben, wer vorsichtig ist, kehrt jetzt zum Hotel zurück.Das Zimmer war gross, etwas dunkel, aber i.O., das Badezimmer ok.Sehr gut war das morgentliche Frühstücksbuffet.","Date of stay: August 2010This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Okay","This hotel as a part of our honeymoon in Africa was okay at most. The staff wasn't that customer friendly. The location of the hotel in central Windhoek is good but the vicinity of the hotel is not safe, even a short walk at daytime made us feel very uneasy.The entrance of the hotel is not the easiest to find, we at first didn't see the little ground floor entrance and were directed to the first floor entrance.With the vicinity of the hotel being not that safe we opted to have room service dinner which actually turned out to be not that bad (maybe the 18 previous hours of travels helped a little :) )From the amenities thought it is definitely not worth a 4 star unfortunately.","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Merita le 4 stelle","Hotel in centro sulla via principale di Windhoeck all'interno di un centro commerciale.Le stanze, piuttosto grandi, sono ben attrezzate e dotate di vari confort. Il wi-fi è a pagamento. La colazione molto buona e molto abbondante, altrettanto dicasi per la cena a buffett (se si arriva tardi e stanchi in hotel è la soluzione migliore). Il personale è molto educato ed affabile. Fanno un po' di confusione alla reception e in sala da pranzo sembrano svogliati, ma occorre tenere sempre conto di dove ci troviamo.E' un posto ottimo per congressi/affari e per una notte di passaggio.","Date of stay: August 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Average at Best","The air conditioner was noisy as hell and stuck on 25 degrees, the room was a sauna.  I complained twice but it was not fixed.  There was no tomato sauce on the first day, ""it's locked up"".  They had no beef in the restaurant or room service the second day.  Room service had no idea what the restaurant could offer.  I eventually went downstairs to ask them and they said they also had chicken available which they could deliver.  A can of Coke was N$20.  Breakfast is N$150 and dinner N$185.Reception smells like smoke from the entrance of the casino and bar right next to it.  There is no direct road access to get into the hotel.  Parking is virtually non existent in front so hopefully you'll be dropped off instead.  You need to walk through the mall and up the escalators to get to the hotel.  I was there 3 days and the escalator was broken all three days - I had to haul my very heavy suitcase full of training material up and down by myself.  Beware of walking around in that area flashing cameras, wallets and bags - my client (locals) warned me that there are plenty of pickpockets around there and can see a tourist a mile away.  I did not have any issues even though I had to walk to my client along that road every day with a full suitcase.The staff are very friendly at reception.  The bed was very comfortable and the room would have been very quiet if it wasn't for the aircon.The staff at breakfast don't have much to do and stand around in groups just watching you eat.  The shower is minuscule in a huge bathroom and there's a glaring bright light right about your head.  So when you've had no sleep from sweltering all night and being kept awake by a noisy aircon, and have to get up at 6am; you get greeted with a strobe light in your face as you wash your hair.  Very unpleasant.The TV and light switches give off a bright glow when switched off effectively illuminating the entire room at night.  I had to cover the TV with a blanket and the light switch with paper so I could get some sleep.  The bedside lamps were not working.There is a a new Hilton hotel right over the road.  I will definitely be staying there next time instead - least you are guaranteed of a consistent experience at the Hilton's across the globe. This was not a 5 star experience for me.","Date of stay: January 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Updated review from last year...","I stayed at the Kalahari Sands in Windhoek in March 2009 and again in April 2010.   I am updating my previous rating.Pros-- Fantastic breakfast buffet - one of the best I've ever had! Its included in the price and makes the stay well worth it.  -- Wireless internet, which didn't work last year, is now up and running.  However, it is EXPENSIVE.  Get ready to pay!-- Spacious room -- A/C in room-- TV with DSTV-- Located in a mall with grocery store, shopping, etc.-- Centrally located in Windhoek and within walking distance to the Craft Market (eat at Paul's!), Gathemann's, and Sardinia, a great Italian restaurant. Nando's and KFC are also within walking distance.-- Friendly staff-- I felt VERY safe in the hotel and in the area surrounding the hotel.Cons-- Elevators are  SLOW. I stayed on the 7th floor. I took the stairs down but waited to take the elevator up, primarily because there are 3 flights of stairs between the ground floor and the 1st floor, making my total trip 10 flights of steep stairs. Luckily, they have someone stationed at the elevators calling them for you so there is almost always one on its way down to pick you up.-- I think they've changed their sheets from last year as mine were so scratchy, they rubbed a sore on my knee.  Ouch.-- Everything in my hotel room was tired.  Tired carpet, tired A/C unit (it barely worked), tired linens, tired TV (always fuzzy reception).  Make no mistake - this is not the nicest place you will ever stay.  However, its clean, comfortable, safe, and centrally located...","Date of stay: April 2010This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Bien situé mais un peu froid","Hôtel très bien situé à 2 pas du centre de Windhoek et en face d'un petit marché d'artisanatBelle chambre bien confortable et bien équipée, avec douche et baignoire, bel écran de télévisionPetit déjeuner copieux et surtout dès 6 heures du matin, ce qui est un plus pour ceux qui ont un avion tôtRooftop très agréable avec petite piscine et une superbe vuePar contre, nous ne conseillerons le restaurant du rooftop. La nourriture n'est pas mal mais peut mieux faire. Nous avions commandé un vin de 2015 et nous apporte un vin de 2020 au même prix et si nous n'avions pas vérifié la bouteille au moment de l'ouverture, on nous la servait (700 dollars namibiens quand même). Raison : on n'a plus de 2015 alors, on vous met du 2020. Bouteille donc refusée et nous n'en avons pas recommandé car cette bouteille nous a été apportée 10 minutes après que nos plats nous aient été apportés. Quant aux plats, un kudu saignant de 250 g avec risotto aux champignons et sauce chimichuri et un kudu saignant de 400 g saignant avec pommes de terre et sauce au poivre commandés, et tout est arrivé inversé. Plutôt qu'un retour en cuisine, le serveur, quoique fort gentil (le seul a à travailler et à se démener), nous a tout bonnement demandé d'échanger les viandes d'assiettes. Pour un hôtel qui se dit de standing, c'est un peu léger. Par contre, les plats étaient bons et copieux. Prix raisonnablesPour les desserts, catastrophe : apportés au bout de 35 minutes et pour un dessert au café avec de la glace, c'était tout bonnement un café avec un boule de glace qui a fondu immédiatement. Prix bof bofPour le personnel, froid à part le jeune serveur du restaurantPour le transport à l'aéroport, clim à fond dans le minibus à 7 heures du matin et musique forte. Le chauffeur n'a même pas demandé si cela nous plaisait ou non mais tôt le matin, on respecte un peu les gens","Date of stay: October 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Schönes Hotel mit gutem Service und tollem Ausblick über Windhoek","Wir verbrachten im Rahmen einer Gruppenreise den Abschiedabend im Avani Windhoek. Der Service ist gut, das Personal ist freundlich. Die Zimmer und das Bad sind sauber und geräumig, allerdings hat die Dusche wie so oft in Hotels den Nachteil eines fest montierten Duschkopfs. Sowas können sich wahrscheinlich nur Männer ausdenken, die nicht daran denken, daß Frauen gelegentlich andere Bedürfnisse beim Duschen haben. Frühstücksbuffet und Restaurant bieten eine gute Auswahl, allerdings fehlt bei Frühstück -- wie nicht selten in Hotels und Lodges im südlichen Afrika -- eine Auswahl frisches Obst.Von der Dachterrasse im 15. Stock des Hotels hat man einen großartigen Ausblick über Windhoek, vor allem im Licht der Nachmittagssonne. Der nächtliche Blick ist zwar auch schön, aber nicht so spektakulär, da Windhoek über nur wenige prägnante Strukturen verfügt. Wir hatten im Dachgeschoß allerdings ein sehr gut zubereitetes Dinner, das sich lohnte.","Date of stay: March 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Tolle Aussicht vom Dachrestaurant","Das Avani liegt sehr zentral in Windhoek, die Zimmer sind groß und sauber. Die Corona-Regeln (Abstand und Maske) werden eingehalten. Leider war unser vorab über die Avani Webseite  zusammen mit dem Zimmer bestellter und bezahlter Transfer nicht am Flughafen. Dies wurde an der Rezepion leider nur mit  Schulter zucken zur Kenntnis genommen. Zusätzlich kam wenige Tage nach Abreise eine Mahnung, dass wir unseren Transfer nicht bezahlt hätten...ohne Worte. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, das Restaurant auf dem Dach hat einen tollen Ausblick und guten Service, doch leider ist der Service an der Rezeption nicht besonders. Auf Fragen nach ""außergewöhnlichen"" Dingen wie Geldtausch, Kauf einer SIm Karte, etc. erhält man nur ""Vielleicht""-Anworten, nach dem Motto ""nix genaues weiß man nicht"". Dass das im Zimmerpreis enthaltene Frühstücksbuffet für Hotelgäste im 1. Stock serviert wird und nicht im Coffee-Shop neben der Rezeption, sollte vielleicht auch zum Wissen eines Rezeptionsmitarbeiters gehören. Ansonsten ist das Hotel in Ordnung für eine Nacht nach Ankunft oder vor Abreise.","Date of stay: December 2020This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"God location and good service","The drive from the airport to the hotel was reasonable quick, the issue turned out to be getting to the parking lot for the hotel. It took a couple of tries and one circle but eventually got there. The parking for hotel guests is on the 4th level of a lot for the adjoining shopping centre. This is one level above the hotel reception and it’s a schlep and a half to get there.  Staff at the front desk were pleasant and very helpful, giving directions to sites nearby and places to grab a snack.The rooms are comfortable, view was so, so. Dinner was buffet still, nothing special but the dessert offering were for want of a better term, habit forming.  I had thirds.  Breakfast the next day was also standard fare, nothing to write home about.","Date of stay: February 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I would definitely stay here again.","Date of stay: October 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First Time Stay at Avani","I enjoyed my stay at Avani. Looking forward to coming back very soon, in one month time. However, I did not like the toilet facility downstairs. The feeling was shared with numerous guest ang suggest should be looked at with urgency.","Date of stay: August 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Construction","I love this hotel but the refurbishment is taking its toll on the overall rating of this establishment. The lifts aren’t working properly and the general disruption throughout the hotel due to construction work is catastrophic. I wish they could close off areas that are out of bounds but the lifts are stopping at floors that aren’t accessible.","Date of stay: May 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Windhoek for 24 hrs ","I stayed at the Avani in WDH, it is Centrally located, next to a mall / supermarket in case you wanted to pop out and get a few goodies The renovations in the reception area and new restaurant  are gorgeous, the rest of the property could do with a bit of an update, rooms and bathrooms were clean, staff all very friendly and polite, lifts were a  bit of a pain, took ages to get to the floor you needed to get to.

"Eigentlich sehr empfehlenswert, aber....","Wir haben im Avani zu Beginn und am Ende unserer Namibia-Trips jeweils eine Nacht verbracht. Beide Male waren die Zimmer gross, gepflegt und sauber. Einziger kleiner Minuspunkt waren die schmutzigen Fenster, welchen wieder einmal eine Aussenreinigung nötig gehabt hätten. Der ganz grosse Teil der Mitarbeiter am Empfang und im Speisesaal waren sehr freundlich und bemüht. Auch das Gratisparkdeck für Gäste mit Mietwagen ist ganz einfach toll und die Roof-Top-Terrasse mit kleinem Pool und Sicht auf die Stadt stehen ebenfalls auf die Plusseite. Trotzdem erhält das Avani von mir nur 3 von 5 Punkten. Das Gebäude mit etwa 14 Etagen verfügt nur über 3 Fahrstühle mit Platz für jeweils etwa 8 Personen. Dies ist für ein Haus dieser Grösse sehr knapp bemessen. Wenn dann wie bei unseren beiden Besuchen nur zwei von dreien und beim anderen Mal gar nur einer funktioniert,  ist langes Warten unvermeidlich. Wir mussten uns jeweils entscheiden, ob wir wieder 15 Minuten langes Anstehen riskieren sollen, oder ob wir die 10 Etagen nicht besser zu Fuss in Angriff nehmen  Zudem waren wir doch sehr überrascht, dass beim Einchecken um 18.15 Uhr unser gebuchtes Zimmer noch nicht bezugsbereit war. Man bat uns in der Lobby Platz zu nehmen und uns zu gedulden. Dort sassen allerdings bereits andere Gäste denen  das gleiche Schicksal wiederfuhr. Da es nicht so recht vorwärts gehen wollte,  entschieden wir uns nach einiger Zeit verschwitzt, schmutzig und müde erst einmal Essen zu gehen. Dies war nicht gerade der Ferienstart welchen wir uns nach der langen Anreise erhofft hatten. Diese beiden Vorkommnisse liessen mich ein wenig ein am Hotelmanagement zweifeln. Nach meiner Meinung sollte es selbstverständlich sein, dass bei technischen Störungen rund um die Uhr ein Notfalldienst aufgeboten werden kann und immer genügend Ersatzteile vorhanden sind. Auch gehe ich nicht davon aus,  dass man ganz kurzfristig vom Gästeansturm überrumpelt wurde sondern schon längere Zeit wusste, dass das Haus gut gebucht sein wird. Daher sollten auch Verspätungen bei der Zimmerreinigung nie so aus dem Ruder laufen.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Misleading and disappointing","From the moment we arrived, couldn’t find hotel entrance, no signs showing Hotel entrance/parking lot, parking building covered with scaffolding’s and under renovations. Call button for porter service at the parking lot was not working. Had to lug small kids and all the bags to the reception. Most of the time only 1 out of 3 lifts were working to go to the rooms. Rooms were stuffy and AC was warm even with 16C. Swimming pool was cloudy and looked like had too much chlorine in it and was bubbling.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Stop in Windhoek","We stayed overnight at the Avani Hotel on our way through Windhoek.  We were driving, so found it complicated a) to find the Hotel and b) to find the underground parking behind the Hotel and then not easy to get all the luggage upstairs to the Hotel, although someone did come to help from reception, but once settled in it is very convenient right in the middle of town and easy to walk to all the interesting spots and shops.   We had the buffet for dinner and breakfast and this was exceptionally good with a huge choice.   Rooms very comfortable, spacious and with a beautiful view over the City.","Date of stay: April 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Simply a place to sleep on a business trip.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Staff were amazing especially their Guest Service Relations Personnel Cheneviev Beukes.","We were welcomed by friendly, helpful and professional staff, check-in is at 2:00pm in the afternoon but we arrived at 7:00am exhausted from a bus trip Cape Town to Windhoek. A sweetest gentleman from behind the counter (reception) was so helpful he checked us in so we could get some sleep we really appreciated that. The hotel is nice and clean, our room was very clean big and comfortable with free WiFi.Breakfast was beautiful with a variety to choose from. Dinner was nice too a buffet dinner, it would have been nice if we had a la carte menu as well.Location was convenient although confusing because the hotel is inside the mall and had to drag our heavy luggage up the escalator as we did not have anyone to help us which we felt a bit vulnerable as you could get mugged without the hotel knowing with no visibility to the street. Overall the hotel is perfect for people visiting Windhoek its in the city centre and reasonable priced I would highly recommend it. Guest Service Relations Personnel Cheneviev Beukes was an exceptional she was so helpful with her professionalism she organised our day tours and airport transfers she was oustanding an asset for Avani.","Date of stay: March 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Shower frame beading was loose. Not really 4 star maintenance....For breakfast I must confess the previous management offered a greater variety - same friendly waitrons running the restaurant.","Date of stay: February 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good location in the shopping centre","During my stay in Namibia I stayed in this hotel twice, I also stayed here 2 years ago when the name was Kalahari Sands Hotel. The service in the reception is now much better than two years ago. Buffet breakfast is very good, but service in general can be very different depending on the day (e.g. according to our experience on Monday morning you hardly see motivated people in the restaurant). The service in the bar is slow and there are always problems with change if you pay cash. Rooms are big and clean with comfortable beds. There is a nice terrace with a small swimming pool (with cold water) on the roof. It´s safe and easy to go shopping, because the hotel is located in the shopping centre. Room rates change a lot. It´s worth to compare rates e.g. using Trivago booking site.","Date of stay: October 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Zudem gibt es ein grosses Frühstücksbuffet mit heissen sowie kalten Speisen.

"Potential to be V Good but missing some touches","Kalahari Sands is well located in the centre of town and the rooms are spacious and clean but there are niggles that let down a hotel which is supposedly 4-star. For a hotel in 2014 which purportedly welcomes business clients, charging for the use of hotel Wifi is no longer acceptable.Secondly as a previous review mentioned, there was indeed a rather unpleasant, sewage like smell emanating from the bathroom in my room and this was before I visited it!","Date of stay: October 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good option","Have stayed twice in the last two months for business.  Both were single night stays and the hotel suited us perfectly as it is located close to where we were working.First time around we struggled to find the entrance to the hotel which is located above a rather dodgy looking shopping centre.  Signage in this regard as well as where to park is severely lacking.  Noticed a number of guests on our second visit having the same problem and we were fortunately able to assist.Once in the hotel, it's the standard Sun International affair.  The rooms are extremely comfortable and clean and can not be faulted.  The lighting is somewhat confusing and on my second stay I couldn't get the bedside lamps to come on at all.Breakfast was good, although the service was a bit slow.  If you catch it in rush hour expect to wait a while.  Found all staff to be friendly and helpful, especially the lady in the bar who was super friendly.I suspect I wouldn't want to stay here for longer stays, but for the 2-3 night business stay it was perfect and will certainly use it again.","Date of stay: November 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Dabei wollten wir nur mal endliche eine Dusche !!!!!!!  Ich war inzwischen gut 22 Stunden unterwegs. Als wir nachfragten ob es nicht möglich  seiein anderes Zimmer früher zu bekommen wurden uns sehr unfreundlich gesagt das gehe nicht, sie könne ja nichts dafür das der Kollege uns am morgen falsch informierthabe.

"Great location, clean rooms, good food","Yes, the lifts are slower than in North America or Europe, but they work. An attendent on the lobby floor will call an elevator for you as soon as you make the slightest move in the general direction of the elevators. The rooms are clean and have all the equipment one would normally expect from a business hotel, and everything works.The business centre is staffed, has the normal equipment, but the internet seems a little slow, although this may be because someone was moving large files while I was there.The buffet for dinner and breakfast was well presented, tasty and had a good variety of food. There are several good restaurants nearby, but the hotel food was more than adequate. The downtown location is great for sightseeing, business or government meetings, but it has the reputation of being in a hot zone. I was never accosted nor did I see anything improper happen.","Date of stay: September 2009This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Badly maintained","Torn carpets in the Dunes Restaurant were a healthy and safety hazard. In the 9 days that we were there one of the three lifts was always out of order, a second was out of order for 50% of the time, and the third out of order around 10% of the time. And this in a 12 storey hotel. Walking up to the 6th floor was no fun at 1500 metres altitude of Windhoek.Breakfast time was chaotic. Our visit coincided with an international cricket competition, and the hotel was very full. Unfortunately there had been no attempt by the management to increase staffing levels at breakfast. We regularly had to wait 10 - 20 minutes for tea/coffee. Food, crockery and cutlery often ran out. Quite appaling for an alleged 4 star hotel.On the plus side, the staff were unfailingly friendly and tried their best in difficult circumstances.The fire alarm was tested without any notice being given. Many residents had walked down several flights of stairs before they realised it was just a test. But now there was 60 or 70 people on the ground floor vying for the one lift that was working.All in all, I could not recommend this hotel.","Date of stay: November 2007This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The rooms are comfortable especially the work station that allows me to work comfortably. The breakfast is a full buffet with variety and it’s easy access to town center because of its location. I practically walk everywhere.","Date of stay: November 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice rooms","I enjoyed my room at The Avani. It was comfortable and spacious. The staff was also very pleasant and helpful. The worst part of my 3 night stay were the restaurant/food options. The rooftop dining was the worst. At 7PM the music volume went up at the adjacent Skybar making for a very loud dining experience. More like dining in a night club than a nice restaurant. Some of the tables are situated along the wall where there was sofa seating. This was so uncomfortable as the sofa was so deep you could not rest your back. Not comfortable at all. The cafe off the lobby is a mixed bag. It's hard to tell what it is. I do know I had the worst coffee of my stay there. I can't comment on the buffet restaurant. I went up there to find 2 people dining along with a lot of food steaming away at the buffet. I decided to pass on that. So, the rest of my drinking and dining was across the street at the Hilton. Much better options in an inviting atmosphere.","Date of stay: February 2020This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"One of the best in WIndhoek","A great place to start or end your trip. Only 40 mins or so easy drive from the airport, so great if you are jetlagged. If you are self driving stop at the front door and someone will come, take your bags, and direct you to the free, covered parking.Very European in standard, nice clean big rooms.

"Birthday Bliss: A Memorable Solo Date at Avani (Stratos)","Today was my birthday, and I decided to celebrate with a solo date at Avani (Stratos). However, my phone unexpectedly shut down, and I found myself without a charger. Fortunately, the waiter at the restaurant was incredibly thoughtful and offered to capture the special moments by taking pictures of me with his cellphone. It was a kind gesture that saved the day. I must also mention the incredible food I enjoyed. The steak was unbelievably tender and juicy, and the chef went above and beyond to make my birthday even more memorable. They personally wished me a happy birthday and even wrote it on the dessert plate. It was such a delightful touch. Overall, I had a truly lovely experience. I highly recommend asking for Jeremy; he is an amazing waiter who made my celebration extra special.","Date of stay: April 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The breakfast at Dunes was a nice buffet with friendly helpful staff Michelle and Johnny who made sure we were very well looked after :) The rooftop bar was spectacular particular during sunset with more friendly staff! Jeremy was so friendly and very helpful. If you are here for the said “casino” just know that casino means pokie machines and you need a card and ID to play them.  The room service was also a bit of a let down as we wanted a bottle of wine delivered to our room and instead we had to leave to go get one from the restaurant upstairs.

"Nice rooms, weird setting, average service","This hotel was in a central location though a bit hard to get to given that it is in a shopping mall that was a ghost town over the holiday weekend we stayed there.  Room was clean, comfortable and nice.  The only funky thing is they have some fancy electricity management system that is supposed to automatically turn the lights on and off.  Well what happens is that you can't really do either.  They didn't turn on when we came in and did turn on when we were trying to sneak quietly to the bathroom in the middle of the night with the kids asleep.  Not the end of the world but fairly annoying.They also advertise laundry service but at least over the weekend had none.  They did offer to have a housekeeper wash a few essentials by hand in our sink but after a week of traveling with a family of 4 that was not going to cut it.  The restaurant is way overpriced with meal buffet prices that were far above everywhere else we traveled on this strip (and we stayed in other even nicer hotels).  Plus there is NOTHING else around here open to eat on Saturdays so they have you as a captive audience (which is probably how they get away with charging so much).  Overall fine, nice rooms, comfortable, friendly service but overpriced with a weird ambience.  I'd look to stay elsewhere next time unless I needed to be in the city center for business.  Even then I'd probably stay a block away at the Hilton.  Certainly wouldn't stay here on holiday again.","Date of stay: December 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Excellent location but staff not well trained","The Kalahari Sands is in a large shopping centre in the centre of Windhoek, making it very convenient for just about everything in the town. Checking in on a Sunday evening took an excrutiatingly long time as there was only one receptionist behind the counter and a fairly substantial queue was moving at a glacial pace. The room more than compensated, however, as it was huge and very clean. There were some noisy guests nearby who insisted on partying until around midnight with the bedroom door open. Breakfast was the usual Sun International type of affair and was workmanlike. Staff appeared disinterested though. Next time would seriously consider the nearby Hilton as an alternative, even though it is a lot more expensive.","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Gerne wieder","Das Zimmer war komplett renoviert, geschmackvoll ausgestattet und sehr geräumig. Der Zugang zum Hotel führt durch ein Einkaufszentrum. Dies ist etwas ungewöhnlich, hat den Vorteil, dass man Supermarkt und Bank schnell erreichen kann. Das Frühstück war hervorragend. Das Hotel liegt direkt an der Haupteinkaufsstraße von Windhoek (Independence Ave.). Abends kann man fußläufig einige Restaurants in der Innenstadt ansteuern. Da es aber zu dieser Tageszeit sehr ruhig auf den Straßen ist (mit Ausnahme einiger Gruppen von  Jugendlichen...) würde ich es beim nächsten Mal vorziehen, mit dem Pkw unterwegs zu sein. Tagsüber ist es aber kein Problem.","Date of stay: August 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Gutes Stadthotel in zentraler Lage","Die letzte Nacht in Namibia haben wir mitten im Zentrum von Windhoek im Hotel Kalahari Sands verbracht. Da es bei unserer Ankunft am Abend schon dunkel war, mussten wir erst mal ein wenig suchen. an der Straße ist die Parkplatzsuche ziemlich aussichtslos also sind wir direkt in das angegliederte Parkhaus gefahren. Von dort gibt es einen direkten Zugang in das Hotel. Ein paar Kofferträger kamen sofort angelaufen, als sie bemerkten, dass wir mit Gepäck den Hotelzugang ansteuerten. Das Hotel ist mit einer Einkaufsmall verbunden, deren Geschäfte aber an diesem Samstag Abend bereits geschlossen hatten. Der Empfangsbereich ist modern und ansprechend ausgestattet. Der Check-in verlief reibungslos und unsere Wünsche nach einem Zimmer mit getrennten Betten in einem oberen Stockwerk wurden prompt erfüllt. Das Zimmer war geräumig und modern und sah aus, wie jedes andere Businesszimmer in einem beliebigen Hotel dieser Kategorie auf der Welt. Eine geräuscharme effiziente Klimaanlage, Minibar, TV und Wasserkocher mit Tee und Kaffeeutensilien waren vorhanden. Das Abendessen haben wir im hoteleigenen Restaurant eingenommen, wo ein sehr gutes Buffet angeboten wurde. Für umgerechnet 17 Euro gab es dort eine sehr große Auswahl an Speisen, die man sich vom Koch frisch zubereiten lassen konnte. Z.B. gab es eine Theke mit asiatischen Speisen, eine Barbecue Theke, Salatbar und bereits zubereitete Gerichte in Warmhalte-Schalen sowie verschiedene Desserts. Wir waren echt begeistert von der Qualität und der großen Auswahl. Das Restaurant war auch gut belegt, zumal es auch aus Sicherheitserwägungen nicht ratsam ist, abends in Windhoek auf die Suche nach einem Restaurant zu gehen. Das Frühstücksbuffet am nächsten Morgen war auch tadellos ; alles dabei, was man von einem Hotel dieser Güte erwarten kann. Als Ausgangspunkt für Stadterkundungen ist das Hotel gut geeignet, da es sich direkt im Zentrum befindet. In Laufnähe sind viele Souvenirgeschäfte, Galerien, Bekleidungsgeschäfte sowie ein Handicraft-Center , welches unbedingt einen Besuch wert ist. Zum Flughafen fährt man etwa 45 Minuten.  Das Hotel gehört zur Sun International Gruppe, die ja in Afrika einige sehr gute Hotels betreibt.","Date of stay: February 2010This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The area is busy but it also affords easy access to shops and convenience stores. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff is attentive and friendly. The breakfast buffet offers a variety of choices. For a backup, you can go to one of the coffee shops in the mall for a quick breakfast. Check-in and out was quick and efficient. The Wi-Fi signal was strong throughout the hotel.","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The bathroom is spacious and there is a bath and a separate shower, a big sink and nice toiletries. There was a wide range of dishes to choose from at the breakfast buffet aswell as at the diner buffet. Staff is friendly and helpful. The only downside was the partly covered rooftop terrace and the very tiny swimming pool.","Date of stay: November 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Stayed in 4 Guesthouses in city previously, should of come to this hotel first. Very Good.","I have stayed in many hotels around the world and I must say that the Kalahari Sands, Windhoek, Namibia has been one of the best experiences for me.They have some great staff, friendly, helpful and professional and has done a fantastic job in meeting my requirements for my short 6 nights stay in total.There were no problems with my stay, apart from the leak in the shower in room 915, which one of the staff fixed, not having access to an iron/iron board and a few very minor maintenance issues in the bathroom (mainly items lose, etc) It was also unfortunate not to be given a twin room on the 2nd weeks stay, as requested, but this didn't matter massively. The food was fine, but scrambled eggs one morning were cold, no other issues in that department.Internet worked ok and so did aircon and TV, etc.Thank you very much for your time and for making our stay comfortable. I had an evening flight on the last day, so my transport was not due until about 18:30. I asked  staff for a late check out and they sorted that out for me. Again, Etienne Coetzee exceeded my expectations, a very helpful staff member.","Date of stay: June 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Clean linens, nice and spacious bathroom, comfortable bed are nice features I noted. Morning breakfast spread was reasonably good with sufficient choices.

"dishonesty","When we arrived at the Inn on September 21, my suitcase had been smashed and delivered as such to the room.  This suitcase was intact before leaving the airport.Our agent made a report that went unanswered.  On October 9, we returned to this Pension before leaving the country.  We met, after several hours of waiting, the """"manager"""" who told us a story to sleep standing.  He told us that they had a video of the luggage and that my suitcase was on top of the carrier and that there was no way that it was damaged by the baggage handlers.How could he say that because he did not know my suitcase and had never seen it?  He also said he couldn't show me the video, which is forbidden by Inn rules.  He mistook us for stupid people and tried to deceive us by refusing to compensate me for the damage caused.This man has been dishonest with us and lied to us. This is shameful for a company that wants to inspire trust in customers.","Date of stay: October 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice Downtown location","This hotel is in the middle of downtown Windhoek and close to everything.  We stayed in August 2018 and they are in the middle of a renovation which wasn't much of a problem but there was only one working elevator.  Rooms are comfortable and quiet.  Located next to the downtown shopping mall.  In the mall there is a grocery/liquor store in the basement so you can shop for snacks/drinks there.  Excellent buffet dinner dining - pick what you want and they will cook it for you - good seafood/game/roasts.If you think of buying alcohol be aware that all stores in Namibia stop selling it at 1pm Saturday and none is sold on Sunday.  You can still get a drink in a restaurant or bar.","Date of stay: August 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A perfectly solid business hotel in the centre of town","We stayed here for three days at the invitation of Air Namibia and had a perfectly fine stay. The room was modern and everything worked well, the beds were comfortable and we slept well. On the other hand, there are currently substantial building works going on, so the lifts work really poorly (but the stairs are great) and there is a loud drilling noise most of the day (but it did stop after 6pm). Also amenities I would expect to find in this kind of hotel were missing : a pool and a gym. We had good meals at the two restaurants (buffet breakfasts and dinners and à la carte lunches), which offered a lot of choice and, at dinner, the different stations allowed to choose how to cook your meat, etc. Parking was simple and free.","Date of stay: June 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comfortable stay despite renovations","The Avani is undergoing renovations and it's already starting to look more stylish. There's a new entrance on the main road, so no need to walk through the mall, up the escalators to find the entranceWith renovations come some inconvenience and with only one lift, ensure you have sufficient time to wait for it if you can't take the stairs as an alternative.Breakfast and dinner are buffet style at the main restaurant or choose something to eat at the Pantry, the smallish space to eat in the reception area.Rooms are spacious and comfortable with coffee making facilities and a small fridge.

"Centralissimo in restyling","Hotel moderno e centralissimo, che piano piano si sta rinnovando. Staff gentilissimo. Camere grandi, comode e pulite.

"Location, Location, Location","This is possibly the best hotel to stay at to explore the beautiful city of Windhoek.  With great tourist attractions within walking distance from hotel including the Christchurch and Memorial.  We visited during their renovations, which took nothing away from the charm, the beauty and the service.  Their staff is possibly their biggest asset.  We had drinks at the bar, not a lot of cocktails on the menu.  For better views i suggest booking on levels higher than 4th Floor.  Their entrance is not visible so you might end up driving around the building a few times before knowing where to enter the underground parking.  The nice thing is that you can walk the main road with cute restaurants, shopping opportunities right there.  The hotel is smack bang in the middle of a shopping centre, which is very busy and not very interesting, ATM right at the front door.  The swimming pool are deserted most of the time.  Breakfasts are an awesome spread with different things most days.  I would stay again in a heartbeat.","Date of stay: September 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"THEY THINK THERE GUESTS ARE IDIOTS","The hotel is going through renovations, only one lift works, it could take you 20 minutes to get to your room from the lobby, so don't be in a hurry to go anywhere. When I arrived back at the hotel on Friday at around 16h00 there was a banging sound as if somebody was making a hole in the wall above me, eventually at 20h30 i called the front desk, Gabriel tried to help but was unsuccessful, asked to talk to the Duty Manager who eventually called me at 23h50. The duty manager assured me he would talk to the contractors who were still inside the hotel at 11h50, yes at 11h50 on a Friday night the contractors are still on site. The banging finally stopped on Saturday morning at 06H30. On Saturday i went tot the front desk to report this, all the staff had knowledge of the incident, promised it won't happen again, BUT Yes you guessed it on Saturday at about 11h00 is started all over again, called front desk and eventually asked for the duty manager to come and talk to me. Afternoon duty manager came to talk to me and basically told me that it is too bad, the contractors have a job to do so STUFF YOU GUEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Eventually on Saturday evening the banging stopped at about 10h00, but not for long. At 05h30 on Sunday morning it started again, I tried to call the front desk no answer. The hotel staff think its ""guests"" are IDIOTS and that they can spin you a story and you had better accept their side of the story. I am alarmed that they hotel can allow contractors to work all night in the hotel, is this not a security risk as well? DO NOT STAY HERE FOR BUSINESS AS YOU WILL NOT GET A GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOTEL THINK THEY CAN TELL YOU ANY STORY AND YOU HAD BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE A RENOVATION TO DO TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Excellent stay in Namibia!!!!!!!!","I've stayed at the Avani Windhoek hotel in Mid September, when I and my husband arrived, there was no potter on duty. A lady at reception with short hair checked us in. After we've checked in she insisted she helps us with the luggage since there was nobody to help even thou they looked quiet heavy on her, when we got to the room it was not yet done but she called one of the room attendants she found on the floor and took sheets from her and she prepared the room for us while she's telling us abit about Namibia since its our first time, for a while I was confused of what she is whether she is a room attendant, female porter, receptionist or I really don't know because she practically did  everything  at that time.Thank you so much Tutateni for making our stay worth while, we will surely recommend the hotel","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Quiet Clean and Comfortable","From the outside this property does not look like much.The check in inefficiency and car parking voucher process are something from two decades back, but once you are through the hustle and bustle of reception and into a room it is very clean, comfortable and spacious.Staff are lovely, happy and polite.In fact, its once of the quietest hotels I have stayed at in terms of guest noise in the corridors, unlike other Namibian hotels I have reviewed.Breakfast was a less than happy experience, you sign your bill, gain access to the restaurant, but I could not eat as there no available tables.In todays world, I image a hotelier has to provide 3 basic things. Clean Linen, Running hot water and a decent Internet connection.Avani Windhoek has the most disgraceful Internet connection I have ever had in a hotel.As functional as this hotel was for me, (besides breakfast) I would never be able to return for this one reason alone.There is no point paying for a hotel, that has made business mobility such a frustration.Besides face to face meetings in town, you would need to go else where to send a follow on email.Its a shame. I would recommend this hotel, unless you need to be connected, and have no rush in the mornings.","Date of stay: August 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A week long visit to Namibia","It was second time at this hotel.Location of the hotel is too good about 2-3 Km from city center but has many tourist attractions at walking distance. The hotel building itself has a shopping mall and checker's supermarket. Only problem is that it closes at 5.30 pm.You will also get too many currency conversion counter withing the building.The rooms are excellent. and staff is very cooperative. It also has casino and a very good bar...a swimming pool on roof top is too small to swim but the view city's from their after sunset is amazing.The hotel offers complementary access gym and sauna though you need to walk the adjacent building  for it.Bit disappointed with the food option as the break-fast options did not change at  all during 6 days of stay.Staff was generous enough to allow me two hours  late check-out.","Date of stay: October 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We were lucky to be staying on a Friday night when the restaurant provides a superb seafood buffet.The casino is an added bonus as a short visit on our last night provided funds that nearly covered the holiday!The only downside is that the entrance to the hotel is on the first floor of a shopping mall and if you have heavy luggage this can be problematic. However, the staff are extremely helpful.","Date of stay: October 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice hotel that is centrally situated.","My wife and I arrived at the hotel with a shuttle service that had been arranged by the hotel. We were collected at their international airport that is more than 40km outside Windhoek.Upon our arrival at reception we were greeted in a friendly and polite manner, and offered a cool refreshing welcome beverage. The hotel porter took over the luggage from the shuttle driver, and we were also assisted with the luggage to our room. The room was found to be neat and clean with comfortable beds and also provided a nice view of the city. We enjoyed breakfast and dinner at the Dunes restaurant where the food quality was found to be of a high standard.We noticed that the hotel which is situated inside the Gustav Voight Shopping Centre, had undergone a major multi-million dollar refurbishment since our first visit in 2009.We also visited the Oasis Bar and Lounge where we enjoyed some cocktail drinks and experienced the service as good and efficient.We spent some time at the Kalahari Sands Rooftop Swimming Pool but found it difficult in obtaining someone to provide us with drinks there. My wife also spent some time in the spa where she was very satisfied with the treatment received.Like all other Sun International Casino’s, the hotel casino was found to be well and efficiently run.We experienced this as a nice hotel with friendly staff, although the service was a bit slow at times. We would definitely visit it again in the future and recommend it to friends.","Date of stay: November 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Experiences from my 4th stay","This was my fourth stay at Kalahari Sands in two years. The location is of course still the best in town, everything is close. The hotel is located in a shopping center with a supermarket in the basement (where you can get snacks and drinks).A Hilton is being built close by and it will surely be a tough competitor for the Kalahari Sands Hotel. Surely Hilton will be more expensive (I have always found good prices for KS) but also the quality will surely be better.New things at the hotel:FINALLY they have finalised the udgrading of the elevators and now they work like anywhere. So this problem is in the past.Slow Internet is no more a problem, this has been updated also.Noise from refurbishment work continues to be a problem (from 7 or 8 a.m. to afternoon). So the sounds of drilling may be a problem if you want to work or rest in your room during the day. No noise during the night from the work.Pool area: one day the pool area was closed and I asked about it. They said it was dirty and had to have maintanance work. I said I knew it is dirty because I saw it but only wanted to go to the sundeck to sit for a while. They never got back to me about this.Breakfast is always great here, although the waiters are very slow in bringing coffee and tea.Dinner buffet is good. Room service menu remains the same, with limited choice.Bathroom toiletries had been updated since last year. Now they offered everything you can wish also in the standard rooms.Until the Hilton opens, KS is definitely the choice if you prefer great location. Country Club Hotel  is superior to KS but the location is - well - the location of a country club.","Date of stay: August 2010This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great location","During the past year I have stayed several times at Kalahari Sands hotel and keep returning. This is mostly due to the great location. The hotel is very centrally located for all sightseeing and business in Windhoek. Shops and museums are close. The hotel is located in a shopping center and there is a supermarket (e.g. for drinks and snacks) in the basement. Taxi-rank is on the opposite side of the road.All in all the hotel is okay and it is good value for your money. The hotel is in some need of refurbishment (some carpets are worn-out etc). Rooms are okay. Standard rooms are rather small but executive rooms are nice.Some refurbishment is going on in the rooms. If you want quietness during the day, ask for a room that has no work going on near-by (this is from 8 am till 5 pm). I had to change rooms because I did some work in my room and could not listen to the hammering.Excellent breakfast buffet. Room service available, although choice is rather limited. Dinner is served only as buffet and it's okay.There is a roof-top pool (cold water).The worst part of the hotel is its elevators. They say they are upgrading them but this was already said in August 2008 (my first visit) and no progress is happening. So be prepared to wait.","Date of stay: August 2009This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not worth the price at all","My stay here was pretty terrible. The reception was always busy, and you had to wait in line each time. Rooms are quite dated, and the shower is like one you might find on a boat. Room service dinner took 1.5 hrs, was pretty terrible, and came with plastic cutlery. Gym equipment was missing parts. The only bright spot was breakfast, which was very good.

"A Vlogger's Dream!","This hotel is literally one of my favorites in Africa! Yes - the whole continent. It's right downtown Windhoek and has unmatched views! Y'all the pool overlooks the city and at night ... what a view! I met up with an influencer friend for drinks and this location was just perfection. The staff were very accommodating and the manager came around to check on us. I love a place that values service and this one does it effortlessly! I suggest going in the evening where you can fully enjoy Windhoek at night.","Date of stay: April 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Stratos","I had the pleasure of being served by Jeremy during my recent visit to your restaurant, and I must say, his service was exceptional. From the moment we were seated, Jeremy greeted us warmly and took the time to explain the menu in detail, offering insightful recommendations that perfectly suited our preferences. Throughout the meal, he demonstrated impeccable timing, ensuring our drinks were topped up and that each course arrived promptly. Jemery’s professionalism and hospitality reflect highly on your establishment. He is undoubtedly an asset to your team, and I look forward to returning soon, knowing that such excellent service awaits.","Date of stay: June 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Toilets - particularly those frequented often for day visitors - can be more pedantic and maintained to a higher standard.

"arrogant and rude staff spoil an otherwise nice hotel","We stayed for one night on the 30th Sept 2013. The hotel is built with a shopping center around it and is actually quite a nice building. Rooms are ok and facilities are fine. Sadly our experience of staying was spoilt by the following. No room safe, having to wait hours to check in due to being fully booked the night before, no mini bar and the staff are all and I mean 99% except one polite lady on the bar are rude and miserable. No one smiles or says hello. No conversations...nothing! Also at 10.15pm while I was asleep a member of staff let themselves into our room. Luckily my fiancee was awake and told the lady we were fine and to get out. No explanation for being there or anything. We complained on check out and were to en the same looks of disgust and arrogance ascheck in. I very much doubt aanything will be done despite me writing down all out grievances...plus we were asked did we take anything from the mini bar after all this so they clearly don't listen either. Shocking service ruins an ok hotel. Avoid at all costs and pay alittle extra for the Hilton.","Date of stay: September 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ingresso nascosto","L'ingresso dell'hotel è al'interno del centro commerciale e se non si sa questo rende molto difficile trovarlo. Il parcheggio non permette l'accesso ai van causa l'altezza del soffitto. Le stanze sono belle e curate e più che discreta è la colazione. Per il wifi (il migliore trovato negli hotel e resort in Namibia) vi verrà dato un voucher gratuitamente. Meglio richiederne uno per apparecchio e non per stanza.

"Staff could do with more smiles","Good location. Beginning to look a bit jaded now but room cleaned well. Staff could do with more smiles & eagerness to help guests, rather than behaving officious. Hey, it is a hospitality business. Maybe they can learn from 'Madaline' at front desk or Ms Shane in the restaurant. Also, can management please vary the breakfast and dinner menus? Wifi was slow.

"Verblassende ""Sterne""","Juni 2012 ,da wir schon mehrmals in diesem Hotel mit seiner tollen Lage im Centrum übernachtet haben waren wir doch etwas enttäuscht. Nach der Renovierung stehen in den Zimmern nur noch ein Stuhl zur Verfügung, einer muss auf die recht guten Betten ausweichen. Da im Zimmer keinerlei Informationen über das Hotel und deren Einrichtung  zur Verfügung standen, haben wir auch  die Bedienung der neuen Lichtanlage erst später verstanden. Der Fernseher war defekt und wurde erst am nächsten  Abend repariert, brauchten wir nicht mehr. Insgesamt ließ die Sauberkeit der Toiletten und der Teppichböden sehr zu wünschen übrig. Die Büffets konnten mit dem Standart der früheren Jahre nicht mehr mithalten und jeden Abend gab es größere Gesellschaften so dass ein frühes Dinner von Vorteil war. Noch einmal würden wir hier nicht übernachten, da es in unmittelbarer Nähe Alternativen gibt.","Date of stay: June 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Shocking","I am currently staying at this hotel (thankfully I am checking out today).  I find it hard to believe it that they can charge this much money for such a substandard hotel.I have had some good service but unfortunately it would have to be much better to make up for this mess.  They did upgrade me to suite but it's a far cry from any other hotel charging $250 a night.I asked for an iron to be sent to my room.  I was told that, for security purposes they did not send irons to the room but I was invited to fill out the laundry list.This place is a dump, the 'stool' for computer use is broken and collapsing, the bed is worn and there is a cheap, used blanket under a very tired cover.I chose this hotel because of the location and internet in room.  Once I checked in I was told the internet 'might or might not work'.  I have stayed at the Windhoek Country Club before and would highly recommend this.Stay away!!","Date of stay: September 2009This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good, central business hotel","Visited twice at each end of my trip to Namibia. Got an upgrade on the second visit. The hotel is a good business style hotel with a casino on the first floor - no noise problem from that. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed. Only used the restaurant for breakfast, which was excellent with an amazing selection of good quality options, even fresh oranges and a squeezer. The roof top bar was also a very nice place to be, with a lively atmosphere on Friday and Saturday nights. Great variety of drinks on offer, with barmen who know their stuff. Prices are low too, compared to Europe. View from the balcony is fantastic.Would stay again.","Date of stay: October 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Praise wher praise is due.","As my other reviews state we have developed the habit of calling here for lunch and last drop of Windhoek Beer at the end of our tours and waiting for our plane home.This time we had a a change of flight times so needed a night stop in order not to risk a drive in from the country. We naturally chose the Avani and the booking was done via our agent.A month out we were warned by friends that there was renovation taking place. Ho hum.So we worried if this was going to be disruptive. It was not.Our transport dropped us at the 'new' front entrance and a porter swiftly grabbed our luggage and took us to the front desk where check in was smoothly handled in a cheerful manner.We were then shown up to our room and all was as expected. Indeed it exceeded our expectations as it was fitted out as a business suite with Bluetooth, TV, Wiffy and a linked printer, plus telephone etc.,The room was very large and the bed comfortable. We had about 24 hours to kill, most of it nightime asleep of course, but the room never felt too small. Arranging a late check out to suit our taxi booking was no problem to the friendly ladies at the front desk. Lovely service.OK one lift was not functioning but we were never kept  waiting.Dinner was in the Dunes restaurant and apart from some confusion over a wine order it was very good. We had been joined by two friends who had just arrived in Namibia that afternoon and there was no problem over them dining with us.The meal was good value and nourishing in a quasi buffet style. Service was exemplary by friendly staff.Breakfast was much the same standard with an excellent choice of cereals, cold cuts and cooked versions. We got coffee brought to the table.We needed to buy a small item and not only did the staff know of a good outlet but the porter from yesterday insisted on accompanying me to the shop and waiting for me to be served. A very nice man who told me he had worked for this hotel 20 years and was on the brink of retiring home. He will be a great loss and we wish him well.We checked out of the room at 11 am and with still an hour or so to kill were made welcome in the lounge and bar with our modest luggage during which time one of the management team dropped by and explained the further plans for the Hotel's upgrade. Perhaps upgrade is the wrong word as it is very good already?So ended our first ever evening stopover in Windhoek itself but based on our experience it may not be the last. Heck they even had Lovebirds perch on my windowsill which, as a keen birder, was the icing on the cake..","Date of stay: January 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Room was good with a nice view of mountains, museum and church.Breakfast was good but very disappointed with the dinner, not recommended even if you are starving.Serving buffet, if you are late, better not taking your time there, also grilling inside the restaurant, smelling really bad and smoke around the restaurant.","Date of stay: February 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Geht so","Das Hotel ist mitten in der ""Downtown"" von Windhoek in einem Einkaufszentrum. Sehr praktisch, wenn man noch ein bisschen Souvenirs shoppen will (bitte beachten, die Geschäfte schliessen um 17:30). Die Zimmer sind gut und sauber, check-in problemlos, aber alles in allem etwas lieblos. Der Rooftop-Pool ist ebenso lieblos. Das Zimmersafe war kaputt, die Serviceleute haben 1h gebraucht um die Batterien zu wechseln. Es gibt keine Hotelinformationen im Zimmer, das Zimmertelefon ist nicht beschriftet. Wenn man mal herausgefunden hat, wie man die Rezeption anruft, erfährt man von dort, dass man auf ein Sandwich 30 Minuten warten muss. Das kostenlose WLAN geht ganz gut.","Date of stay: October 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Mostly well, few annoyances, couple of disappointments","Rooms are spacy, well equiped and well cleaned and maintained. Laundry is quick and well done, as is 24h room service. Sleep quality was excellent, no disturbances and quiet troughout. Buffet meals in the restaurant were more than adequate, wide choice of food and in good supply. Slow and defective lifts were a major annoyance, as is the internet WiFi the hotel offers at prices that are in no way justified by the poor quality of the connection, the cumbersome log on system and the intermittent availability.  Using Skype to log on to the same WiFi operator worked excellent, consistently and at high speeds, suggesting that the hardware is ok but the allocation of bandwith to paying users is too stingy. At the room rates charged, WiFi should be unlimited and complimentary.The roof pool is a major let down. It has the appeal of a dead bunny. It is on the top floor of the hotel but completely walled in and has no views at all. Its size and 1.25 m depth are such that the warning that no life guard is on duty can only be for compliance reasons.","Date of stay: March 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ottimo soggiorno","Abbiamo soggiornato al Kalahari Sands per due notti a causa di un'emergenza (infatti non erano previste) e, prezzi a parte, un po' cari,  ci siamo trovati bene: la posizione centrale dell'hotel, che si trova all'interno di un mall dove si può trovare di tutto, la stanza molto ampia e pulita, la colazione buonissima e varia....le uniche due note a sfavore: la poca cordialità di un paio di receptionist e la connessione wifi a pagamento e carissima (1 giorno di connessione = 14 euro circa).","Date of stay: August 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Paying for wifi today is pure madness","I have stayed in a number of places in Windhoek, traveling regularly on business.First and foremost, I was astounded to find out that you need to pay for the wifi service!  it would also be helpful to be told this when you check in so there is no need to go back to reception for a voucher.Breakfast was poor and the service unacceptable, bar lunch was good but again service is distinctly lacking.  My waiter walked away as I was still ordering.  I was quite astounded.Room was fine and faced the city although my colleague complained about the noise of construction work noises from his room.  No room turndown in the evening.Parking was confusing so ask for a map to get into the parking area with your reservation.Many better places to stay in Windhoek.","Date of stay: February 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Stunning views and excellent rooftop bar","I visited this hotel recently with friends who lives in Windhoek and a good time was had by all. It is recommended to visit the rooftop bar at sunset for the wonderful sunsets and vistas.This hotel is very popular with locals and foreigners alike and one hears many languages on the deck, German being the most spoken followed by English, italian and French.

"I couldn't have asked for more","I happened to pop into this hotel, as I had not made a reservation anywhere in Windhoek.  When enquiring about the rates, the lady at reception asked if I was a pensionner.  When I replied that I was she informed me that special rates were then available - I answered that that was the first time age had worked in my favour!  And very reasonable rates they were.  She personally chose the room for me, on the 14th floor with a fabulous view of the city and the surrounding hills, service was excellent, and reception telephoned me every evening to ask if there was anything I wanted/needed.  The rooms were large and comfortable and the bathroom was also large - with a bath and a separate shower - and all was very clean.  As the hotel is right in the centre of town, it was the best - and in the end only - choice I could have made.  What really made it stand out for me were the ladies on reception and the Head of the cleaning staff at least on the 14th floor, who informed me that she wanted all her guests to feel special which is why she has been working at this hotel for 20 years.  And as far as I was concerned she succeeded.  Many thanks to you all ladies.","Date of stay: November 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Choose KS Hotel for CBD location only","I had a three night stay at the KS hotel in Feb 2009. The lifts are still ""under repair"" so I was pleased to have a 4th floor room and could use the stairs. I was staying with a group who had a room block of ~10 rooms and the joke at dinner was: ""What's wrong in your room?!"" as many experienced a variety of issues, large and small. My room had a very leaky air conditioner, so the ice bucket and towel had to be on the desk for our entire stay. I would liken the room decor and condition to a US Holiday Inn circa early 90's - nothing flashy, plenty of room, generally clean, but worn.My service experience was much better -- the front desk was accommodating if you don't get a trainee helping you and the business center staff was top notch in personality and helpful knowledge. The wireless internet in the room was extremely slow / not working as the front desk had warned me when I checked in. It made most sense to hook up the laptop at the business center or use their internet terminals which functioned fine.Our group had dinner one night in the restaurant buffet -- the food was very good, but the table service was lacking.I would not choose KS again unless I absolutely needed to be in the CBD and walking distance to a meeting / office.","Date of stay: February 2009This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Primeira vez em Windhoek - Namibia","Hotel reformado apos nova direcao, melhorou muito, mas continua falho na qualidade dos servicos, desde camareira, manutencao dos aposentos, porem no conjunto merece destaque pelo bom gosto na decoracao, atendimento de algumas pessoas mais antigas que mantem a hospitalidade ja inexistente na equipe nova que aos poucos esta sendo complementada com os novos donos. Tem um restaurante bonito, porem se chegar com mais de uma hora do inicio do atendimento a reposicao do buffet é lamentavel. Tambem a qualidade do que é servido, existem muitas coisas industializadas e prontas o que faz entender a fraca cozinha. A te mesmo os pratos ou grelhados na chapa feitos na frente do cliente é fraco na qualidade e especialmente no preparo por falta de experiencia...por isso nao é muito frequentado, a maioria sao de hospedes que ainda nao conhecem, ou seja, nao retornam mais, entram pelo ambiente e apresentacao do buffet mas é so enganacao, o setor de saladas é praticamente inexistente, bem fraco, na variedade e qualidade.

"Under Construction with LOTS of work to be done","The hotel and shopping complex are undergoing major renovation and construction. We only stayed two of the three nights we booked because of the noise. While on the surface it looks like a very modern and stylish hotel, the underlying service and accommodations are very much sub-standard. for example, the elevator they told us to use looked brand new, but it must not have been programmed correctly because it would not stop at floor 3. Several times we had to hike from the 4th floor because it kept by-passing the stop. Also, just outside our room was a door marked ""staff only."" This door was kept closed all day long, but after 10PM, it was open and closed loudly several times. We complained after the first night, but the practice continued the second night which prompted us to find other accommodations. The front desk staff was curt, and the rest of the staff seemed either obtuse or apathetic. Certainly it was not what was advertised. The breakfast was a standard buffet, and dinner wasn't much more impressive. The location was pretty perfect for walking around the city center, and it felt much safer than other African cities. Overall, it is a serious stretch to call this a luxury accommodation. It might be fine for a business trip, but not a vacation or weekend away. Certainly not worth the price tag.","Date of stay: August 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

La entrada está dentro de una especie de galerías comerciales, pero después el hotel te sorprende.","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Buona scelta ","Albergo sito in centro città al primo piano di un centro commerciale. Proprio vicino all'entrata del hotel c'è anche una banca dove si possono cambiare i soldi prima di iniziare il proprio tour in giro per la Namibia. La camera è molto bella, ampia e pulita. La colazione è ottima e ricchissima","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very very dissapointed at level of ownership of service","I was there for 3 night end June with friends. We had 3 rooms, 2 of which checked out a day earlier. On checking oit we left a box of things to be sent up to my room at the reception which was never delivered. Called thrice at night when I got back to the hotel and they kept saying they are checking to the point they tired me out....HAd an early morning flight so had to leave without the box. It was a very well orchestrated theft of the box and no one took ownership. I even sent an email to the hotel on their email addressed to the CEO of the Hotel, but no response there either. I would not suggest this hotel to anyone. Can you imagine that the staff had warned me to be careful of theft on the streets which I felt were very safe and the people very friendly, but theft happened in the hotel itself..... Wow !Also I booked a transfer to the Airport 2 days in advance, confirmed the same the night before and when I came down to leave for the airport the receptionist had no idea what I was talking about. How unprofessional can one get, that too at a so called star property...","Date of stay: June 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"""Staying at the Avani Hotel""","The hotel is very centrally located. I received a very warm welcome from the front desk staff. The rooms were spacious and clean. Although it was quite busy as there were a number of groups checking in and out, the hotel was pleasantly very quiet. Wifi was complimentary and reasonably fast. The first night we were there, there was a chocolate on the bed but not for the remainder of our stay (we stayed there for four nights). The waiters were very friendly. Also enjoyed the spa services. Visited the casino one evening, the person at the front desk in the casino needs an extra pair of hands on Friday and Saturday night as the place was very busy. My only gripe was that the hotel does not offer a shuttle service from the airport as is the custom with Avani Gaborone.","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Inefficient and unprofessional","Unfortunately the hotel felt unorganised and overwhelmed. I understand that it is a busy time of year for them, but we couldn't eat dinner in the restaurant because they were full, so the only option was to get room service. It took me almost an hour to place an order for room service. Then the person who was responsible for room service could hardly speak English. Really poor service considering it costs so much per night.","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hotel in a Mall","The location is very central and there's plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance but it's very odd having to go into a mall to enter the hotel. It gives it a very corporate feel. There is also construction going on next door and I asked whilst checking in if I should prepare myself for noise, they said there wouldn't be any. Low and behold the construction site came alive in the morning just below our window. We stayed there twice and when we returned the second time they didn't have our reservation.  Luckily we had a printed copy so they made an effort to find us a room despite being full.  They did give us a room and honored the price but the checkin took quite a bit of time.  However, since the rooms are very modern and comfortable, the breakfast is very good and the staff was helpful, I give it an above average rating.","Date of stay: March 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"così così","Questo hotel non mi ha entusiasmata molto, la struttura è un po' vecchia con l'ingresso che affaccia su un piccolo centro commerciale. Le camere non sono bellissime ma funzionali. La posizione è centralissima e il personale è davvero cordiale, secondo me sono i due punti di forza dell'hotel.","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Etape dans la capital.","Cet hôtel est très correcte. Pas très glamour, car en plein centre commercial. Mais près de tout à pied. Pas mal pour effectuer les achats souvenir avant de rentrer.Les chambres sont grandes, propres et jolies. Mieux vaut être assez haut dans les étages, car au 2ème étage, nous avions la vue sur les clims d'un moche bâtiment bleu.

"Good hotel in convenient location","Perfect for short stay in Windhoek and is a short walk from all sights. Good rooms and bathrooms.  Staff are very helpful. I had a great nights sleep. Breakfast buffet could be improved and the fresh fruit selection did not look amazing. Best part of breakfast was the made to order eggs (anyway you want it). I would stay here again.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Gutes Stadthotel","Zentral gelegen, Zimmer und Bad sauber, Ausblick auf Fabrik nicht gerade super. Trotz 4 Fahrstühlen wartet man mal 5 Minuten. Personal ein wenig langsam, 2 Stunden um einen Koffer zu erhalten, den anderen hatten sie an der Rezeption vergessen. Nettes kleines Kasino, Bar beschrängte Getränkeliste und ziemlich langsam, Wifi gratis. Frühstück ganz ok. Hatten dort eine Uebernachtung als Start für die Besichtigung Namibias.

"Right in the middle of town","Great hotel in the middle of town. Very useful as a stopover on the way to Namibia's many activities. The staff were very friendly. I had my own vehicle and found the hotel OK but the parking is around the back. You need to drive around the block to find it. The reservation desk will validate your parking ticket. The meals were good and the bar service friendly. I would stay there again.","Date of stay: May 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My home in Namibia","It's not the newest and swankiest hotel in Windhoek but I always land up in Avani Kalahari (that's the new name of the hotel) because of the friendly staff. They exude a warmth which makes you feel like you're coming back to family. The buffet is one of the betters ones in the city too.","Date of stay: November 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sentiments mitigés","Les chambres sont très confortables avec un airco qui fonctionne bien. L'hôtel est bien situé au centre de Windhoeck mais manque toutefois de charme car il est localisé au premier étage d'un centre commercial. Excellente cuisine et large choix au restaurant.  Nous avons cependant malheureusement été aspergés de vin rouge par un des serveurs.  Cela peut arrriver mais on ne nous a offert aucune compensation ou excuse.  Agréable bar avec certains jours un orchestre. Piscine sur le toit mais vide de toute eau !","Date of stay: August 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hotel not accessible for disabled traveller","The Kalahari hotel is an average hotel. While we had managed to get a disabled friendly room, access to the hotel is not really easy. No access from the parking garage, very little access from the road.  Access from the welcome centre but this is a schlep as someone has to go inside to open the door. All in all very awkward and unpleasant experience. Lifts were extremely slow = not stopping at the designated floors etc. Breakfast was good with a variety of options hot and cold buffet. Service average. Room was comfortable and accessible.","Date of stay: April 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great hotel, needs better staff","Located smack in the centre of Windhoek makes this hotel attractive indeed. And yes it is placed inside a shoppingmall and it has a casino+ why anyone finds that bad I dont really understand. You feel secure and you are not pushed into anything. Decor of the hotel is brilliant & kept clean.My room was on the 10th floor, quite good size, large comfy bed, huge flatscreen sat tv, aircon which worked perfect, safe, fridge incl 2 bottles of mineralwater per day, coffee & tea maker, bathroom is huge too, tub and shower, toiletries. Cleaning everyday and smling wonderful ladies. WIFI is NOT free, you are able to buy a variety of solutions suiting your needs, and pricing is fair and connection very good, however it should be free in a lux hotel. Pure comfort and delight.The only thing this hotel lacks is more proffesionalism from staff. First of all, if a hotel prides itself by Luxury the staff should not lie around and sleep, and at least give a nodd when greeting its guests instead of the typical african expression #empty look staring into the blue#, seems arrogant. I had the halfboard option and upon checking in I was told that all hotelbeds bookings were on room only basis....maybe so but I had booked and payed for HB. Instead of humiliating its guest by the counter, they could have checked the papers...and sure I had the halfboard option. On 3 occations I needed to defend this booking even the papers were there and upon check out I had to pay something dinnerextra anyhow- my advise to other guests, dont book the HB option because the restaurant is the biggest let down of this hotel. I am quite sure you can find better just outside the door.Its a buffet restaurant, which i usually love. There is plenty of staff, unfortunately they seem more interested in themselves having loud conversations while people waiting for their drinks etc. Finally when beeing served most female staff simply act arrogant and rude. They  dont greet you when coming into the restaurant...the carvery staff didnt care to come carve the chicken or roast...why are they there?I for sure did not feel welcome at all, and if I did not have my unaccepted HB plan I would not waste my time or money in this place. I found the food lukewarm and bland in taste.Things might look posh and modern, but a hotel is only as good as the service of its guests..Hotelstandard is indeed worth its 4 star rating, I even think it could be more- but for the guest experience I can only give 3 star and thats a shame really. Its not a cheap place to stay, so service should point in same direction..","Date of stay: January 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Rooms are large and the bathrooms have shower and bath. Buffet breakfast is very good as are the dinners.

"Central location - rooms have good standard","We stayed at the hotel for two nights while we were planning/organizing our Namibia trip. The hotel is located very central with walking distance to major attractions, shopping malls and restaurants. Prices can be high in the season so book early. Rooms are modern, comfortable and clean. Good value for money. Only drawback: wifi is not included in the room rate and needs to be purchased. This is not acceptable for a hotel of this class and price. Every backpacker's lodge offers already free wifi anywhere in the world.","Date of stay: May 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good location, but rooms need updating","This place is in really great central location, they arranged for us for airport transfer and it worked out very well (the airport is ridiculously far from town, at least that how it felt). The staff was very friendly and helpful, but the rooms looked like they needed some work - everything seemed kind of old, but not in the good rustic sense. I believe they were doing reconstruction on some of the floors already, so this may get a lot better soon. We had breakfast at the restaurant and it was one of the best we had during our trip.","Date of stay: November 2010This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Zentrale Lage, aber nichts Besonderes","Mitten im Zentrum Windhuks liegt das Kalahari Sands. Es ist ein Hochhaus, sieht von aussn nicht besonders schön aus. Wer ein Zimmer in den oberen Stockwerken ergattert, hat eine wunderbare Aussicht über die Stadt. Die Zimmer selbst sind OK, aber nichts Besonderes für europäische Verhältnisse. Frühstücksbuffet sehr reichhaltig. Servide bemüht. Kleiner Pool auf dem Dach, ebenso ein Mini-Fitness-Studio. Wer auf der Durchreise ist und nur ein, zwei Nächte in Windhuk verbringt, ist hier gut aufgehoben. Wer etwas mehr Individuelles sucht, ist andernorts besser aufgehoben.Ach so ein Kasino ist auch gleich im Hotel.

"Decent","No hardship to stay here. Don't go in expecting 5-star service as you might get it in North America, but it's comfortable and decent, and we got a good rate for staying longer. The rooms are clean, the bathrooms are modern and clean, there are no weird smells, non-smoking really means non-smoking (not next to smoking rooms so you still have to deal with the smell), the breakfast buffet is excellent (number of items, choice, selection, freshness).Hotel elevators are still slow (as reported by people as far back as Feb. 2009) but it's no big deal.Internet is available in the rooms although it isn't super fast. Those people that have trouble getting on-line may have older computers.No gym but there is a spa. Quality of the services is average but the prices are good compared to Europe and North America. e.g. 60 min. massage for 25 euros.Room service is decent too. Quality of the meals is great, speed of service is excellent and the price is good too, especially for room service! e.g. the beef burger is only 3.50 euros!","Date of stay: July 2009This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Old Darling needing a facelift (or two)","I have stayed at Kalahari Sands twice. Both times, the lifts have not been working properly resulting in long waiting times - which can be as long as 15 minutes.The property is undergoing some sort of refurbishment, which caused some noise during the day. Otherwise, the hotel is very quiet and peaceful.The rooms I have stayed in were quite spacious and decent. Nothing fancy, but a solid slightly worn ***-gear. Bathroom was clean, but again not from the latest collections.The front office staff was very kind and efficient. They even knew that the wireless network is not strong in the room allocated for me and asked if I wanted another.As some earlier reviews discounted the dinner buffet, I decided to try it. It was not actually so bad, but neither was it something special. I think it will not be difficult to find better alternatives. The lobby bar serves some light meals, which are better value for money. The staff at the bar is slightly uninterested, but they are an exemption from the rest. The bar houses also some local entrepreneurs, which may make it inconvenient for other ladies or those with children.There also is a small roof-top pool and a couple of sun chairs. It usually is a nice and quiet place, if you somehow manage to get up there… the same dysfunctional lifts referred to earlier should take you here. In the interest of time, I took the stairs.The location of the hotel is very good. There are many nice restaurants just around the corner. The area, and especially Independence Avenue, usually is safe during daylight, however the streets behind the hotel may not be.","Date of stay: March 2008This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
