"Expensive but not value","The hotel is well located but the facilities provided were not to the level of the Hilton. The staff were trying to help but there are things which could not be translated into the service. The room i was allocated on the first floor smells of strong cigarette smoke even though the staff assured me that the rooms are non-smoking. Some of the amenities in the room were broken and not fixed and bedsheets/pillowcases are not changed for my stay (i stayed 4 nights).","Date of stay: February 2020This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice, clean hotel","After 2 weeks of a trip around Namibia, it was a welcome change to be in this 'corporate like' clean Hilton. Due to our diamond status, we were upgraded to a large suite room and had access to the executive lounge. Parking was convenient and cost a small amount of money.","Date of stay: August 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Long wait for checkin","the hotel has beautiful rooms, an incomparable view from the pool, and the breakfast was very good, but: when we arrived in the afternoon around 3:00, most of the rooms booked for us were not yet ready, so we could not move in. The staff at the reception seemed disinterested or overwhelmed, also the manager did not show whether he was interested in our problem. Finally, after more than three hours of waiting, we were able to move into our rooms. I have never been treated so disrespectfully in any hotel. This was not worthy of a hotel with the Hilton name.","Date of stay: September 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very disappointed","Decent stay but be careful when paying for extras on your room. I was double charged and despite providing evidence the hotel had charged two different cards they refuse to accept the error or refund my account.Very disappointed with the lack of support from a ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù","Date of stay: June 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Most grateful to Violet for going extra miles beyond her call to duty. She deserves all appreciation and encouragement","I was at Hilton Hotel for a technical meeting. Unfortunately forgot my laptop charger on return back to my duty station. I was impressed with the sense of responsibility by Ms Violet to trace the item and organize sending the items by courier. I am very Impressed with support from Violet to recover lost but found items. Thanks to the entire team that recovered this item.","Date of stay: August 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappointed","I thought making a booking at a known chain at the end of a tiring road trip sounded safe, but we were disappointed. The bathroom had hair in it. The staff was somewhat snotty. The ground floor cafe was poorly run. Overall it was okay, but again, we were just disappointed. We kind of needed a friendly place to stay at that point.","Date of stay: December 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lage perfekt","Ich bin ein Hilton-Fan, so habe ich mich auch in Windhoek in dieser Kette einquartiert. Die Hauptstadt Namibias gibt nicht so viel her und ist recht klein, doch steht das Hilton wenige Meter vom Zentrum entfernt. Die Bedienung ist nett, manchmal leider etwas √ºberfordert. Die Zimmer sind luxuri√∂s, mich st√∂rt nur das integrierte Badezimmer und das WC, welches lediglich durch eine Milchglasscheibe vom Zimmer getrennt ist. Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist reichhaltig, besonders zu empfehlen ist das Abendbuffet um ca. 25 Dollar. Niemals zuvor habe ich bessere Austern gegessen.","Date of stay: January 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice upscale property in the heart of Windhoek - great skybar and pool!","It is important to note that I am ranking all the hotels we stayed at (7) based upon where these hotels are (e.g., Ranking them on Southern African standards not European or America...so a 4 star hotel in Southern Africa is not necessarily a 4 star hotel in Chicago. I did this to be fair and give my readers proper perspective)..okay on to the review....We stayed here for just one night on an 18 day trip through Southern Africa. The property is very modern and seems newer.  It is a full service hotel with a great pool and sky deck bar.  The rooms all seem updated and were quite nice.Here are the pros and cons:1.  The rooms are very nice and modern;2.  The on property restaurants were very nice and the food was good;3.  The sky deck bar and pool were outstanding;4.  Nice central location5.  Really nice staff and service.  We had a 3 am departure to catch a flight and the staff went out of their way to make sure that coffee service was set up for us at 2:45am and breakfast boxes were ready so we had the ability to eat.  This was for 13 people - I would  have given them 5 stars just for that...outstanding effort.6.  Wifi was excellent.  In Southern Africa Wifi is hit or really miss...the Hilton's wifi was a 5 star experience.Cons:1.  Only one real issue.  Their is tight security on the elevators to ALL the floors (which is great given that their is a very happening bar open to the public on the top floor), however, the staircase is unregulated.  We literally were able to walk up the staircase and access our various floors without any access control.  I think the hotel would be wise to tighten that up.2.  The room is the new ""modern open"" concept...so there is really no privacy between the room and the bath.  Some people like this and some don't.  It is fine but just want people to be aware.All in the property was one of the best we stayed at during the 18 days and I have rated as such.  I would highly recommend it.","Date of stay: July 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Some good, some bad","Stayed there for two occasions, both times for three nights. The airportpickup was fine, yet when I arrived to the hotel during the aerly hours they claimed that they had given my room away.. Since I arrived early in the morning I booked the room for the night before - it was prepaid and the reservation also had a note telling about my late arrival. Plus of course the hotel managed my pickup so they should have been well aware of my arrival time. After a serious argument they gave me the room. It was hot, really hot.. I called the reception and they sent someone from maintenance up. The guy said that AC can only be switched on for the whole floor and since it was freezing outside he would really not want to do that. Ok, I asked if he could turn it on later, he said yes but of course this was the end of the story, I checked out for a weekend in Etosha and came back two days later and again - they claimed that they do not have my reservation.. even though I had a prepaid voucher that I presented to them. This time I only got the room as I had to present at a seminar that took place in the hotel the next day.. But when I got to the room it was not cleaned. So down I went again.. This night I also got some free entertainment as there as a nightclub somewhere below my room (not sure whether it was in the hotel but the music was loud)Now it was not all negative though. Rooms are ok, bed is comfortable. Room service food was good and not expensive. Internet is decent. Breakfast was very good. The hotel has a nice rooftop bar and a small swimming pool. Conference facilites are ok.I rate this property as poor simply because there was way too much mess for my stays.","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice kickoff to trip around Namibia","I spent 2 nights here before joining a 12-day safari all around the country.  It was a very comfortable, quiet couple of days.  A couple of notes:1) as others have said, the bedroom/bath are somewhat open to each other, so be aware.  Not a problem for those traveling solo, but....2) the premium lounge was very nice, and the rooftop bar and pool provided a lovely place to lounge away the afternoon3) I had a very nice massage--not the best message I've ever had in my life, but definitely the best $30 1-hour massage I've ever had (thanks to the favorable US-Namibian Rand currency exchange)!!4) as a single female, the desk and bell staff were quite concerned about me walking around the city by myself.  I arrived early-afternoon on a Saturday, and wanted to go out somewhere to experience the city, and received several warnings about how to stay safe and where not to go.  I should note that I felt perfectly safe the whole time, but appreciated the warnings.All in all, it was a very nice stay, and i would stay there again for certain!","Date of stay: June 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"5 Sterne ist nur die Einrichtung und der Preis","Das Hotel ist zentral gelegen im Stadtzentrum, der historische Teil von Windhoek ist gut zu Fuss erreichbar. Design und Ausstattung des Hotel ist modern und hat alles von (kleinem) Swimmingpool auf dem Dach ""mitten' neben der Bar, bis hin zum Fitnessraum, usw. Die Zimmer sind sauber und modern im √ºblichen Hilton Standard. Das Hotel ist relativ neu und das meiste funktioniert (noch). Der Schwachpunkt des Hotels ist der Standard des Personal. Sei es an der Rezeption, beim Concierge, im Speisesaal, in der Executive Lounge, an der Bar usw: meistens inkompetent, unzuverl√§ssig, unwillig und zuweilen auch unfreundlich. Nach 4 Tagen konnte ich immerhin jeweils eine Person je Abteilung/Fundktion identifizieren, welche hilfsbereit war und versuchte zu helfen. Die Liste aller negativen Erfahrungen w√§re schlicht zu lang, ich gebe daher nur eine allgemeine W√ºrdigung der Erlebnisse mit dem Personal.Insgesamt ist die Service Qualit√§t Meilen entfernt von Hilton Standard, geschweige von 5 Sterne Qualit√§t.","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hhm, not convinced... ","I booked here as a treat to myself after nights of touring and camping, but I'm not convinced it was a good choice. Room nice, but no robe or slippers. Really wanted to get comfy and pad around in slippers! My main problem was with the Sky Bar/Pool area. I had to find my own towel, nobody takes care in welcoming guests to the area and in four hours I was never shown a menu or offered a drink. On going up to the bar myself, it took 5 minutes to even be acknowledged, staff too busy serving ice buckets of champagne to others. Other members of staff just simply kept walking past me. I would put it down to the staff not being in control of the area. Men at a table next to me brought their own laptop and pumped out their own rap music (also kept cutting off songs midway and changing tracks). Resulted in me moving away with a thumping headache. The bar should have control by providing chill out background tunes thereby dictating the vibe. It shouldn't be an area for wannabe gangsta rap djs! No class. In the evening, I went back up to enjoy outdoor dining under the stars. I ordered a pizza but 10 mins later, waitress had to double check which pizza as she'd forgotten. Again no real service. With no waitress walking around, I had to order at the bar which resulted in someone taking my table when I stood up! Upon asking for Tabasco or Mayonnaise, I was brought mustard and told there wasn't anything else. I'd like to draw a parallel with the Shangri-la Dubai. They also have a pool/bar area which changes into a bar/club at night. The difference is that the vibe is created by the setting and the clientele respond to it. Not the other way round.","Date of stay: April 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"New but poorly functioning","Here just 12 hours as part of a tour of southern Africa.  This is a modern appearing facility that didn't just run right and/or wasn't laid out properly.  Key card system in elevators didn't work, wouldn't stop as programmed; shower and bathroom doors didn't shut properly, hot and cold faucets in rooms mislabeled, towel bars on sinks had protruding handles that caught whatever you were wearing; long wait to check in while manager stared at the overworked receptionist and obviously could not be bothered to lend a hand, etc, etc.  This was a study in how NOT to manage a hotel!  The bright spot was breakfast-lovely house muffins and a full assortment of goodies; smiling staff.","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Service ist eine Katastrophe","Eine imposante ""Erscheinung"", eine traumhafte Terrasse im 9. Stock, eine Super Ausstattung innen. Wir wollten nur ein kleines Mittagessen mit Aussicht genie√üen.

Ergebnis war nur geringf√ºgig besser, alles in allem ungenie√übar. Und das zu dem doppelten Preis von anderen Lokalit√§ten.

"Standard Hilton without Great Service","This was a standard Hilton property. Decent rooms, modern, rooftop pool and good value for money. With gold status we enjoyed a great included breakfast along with wine and snacks in the concierge lounge (which was actually just a side-room off from the restaurant).Neighborhood is safe for walking around. There is nothing to see/do, but there are some stores if you need them.Service was sometimes slow - check-in and checkout was too slow, as was the service in the concierge lounge.","Date of stay: May 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was quite pleased","The room was clean and is well laid out and illuminated.  The desk/laptop arrangement worked well.  I did not like the bathroom vis a vis its relationship to the room -- it is in effect, a part of the room; no door separating it from the room.  Lots of frosted glass.  All very modern, boutique-ie.  Not my taste.  But it works just fine, except that the toilet mini-room is under-lit and the sink is very slow to yield hot water.  The shower gets HOT fast.  Iron and board in the room.The selection of TV channels was so poor that I never watched it.The internet was easy to log into and after an initial interruption when I checked in, worked fine all week, but very slow on Sunday.  However, the desk chair was far too low, and uncomfortable to boot.Laundering a man's shirt, undies, and sox costs N$110/US$8.00, a bargain.The breakfast buffet was good; the coffee was hot, served from a thermos carried by staff.  They were not always there when you wanted them.  There is a wonderful fresh-fruit juice bar.Staff friendly, service-oriented.In the midst of a vibrant neighborhood.","Date of stay: February 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Internet speed here is HOPELESS!!","Internet speed here is HOPELESS!!Cost for more powerful modems is tiny. Stayed here 3 times over 14 days. EACH time internet was terrible speed. Each time this was reported to desk staff who of course all promised it would be fixed immediately. This is Africa ‚Äì nothing changed.  BAD. We spend many hours on internet each day in Hotels. Reported this to a Duty Manager. Nothing occurred for me via the Hilton ‚ÄùMake It Right‚Äù program.  No surprise.  This is Africa.Arrived late afternoon and even then room not ready.  Took 2 hours to get room key.  When we got to room, the Hilton internet did not recognise were were guests. This meant we need to phone someone. Room phones are a joke. Nothing works. 10 department buttons and only ONE works - just front desk line - which may or may not be busy. Phone in room 807 said on it, this was room 614.  LAZY. 2 of the 3 Elevators were not working when we made our first stay. This is Africa.I am a high level Elite at Hilton, so rooms we got were nice.  In fact overall Hotel good.  Nice breakfast.  Average Executive Lounge at Hilton Windhoek.  We were there for New Years Eve, and no wine of any kind.  Desk person claimed all the wine was all taken for NYE party in Skybar. (Wine in Namibia costs about $US1 a bottle wholesale.)  After a few guests complained she reluctantly went out and found 1 bottle red, 1 bottle white. Both bottles were empty in 5 minutes, and were never replaced.  APPALLING for a Hilton alleged ‚Äò‚ÄôExecutive Lounge.‚Äô‚Äô  This is Africa.FIX THE APPALLING INTERNET SPEED.  We had FAR faster speed in remote bush tent camps in Etosha and Soussavlei, and even in a humble guest house in Swakopmund ‚Äì even coffee shop Internet everywhere was much faster than Hilton Windhoek and that is DISGRACEFUL for any Hilton.  This is Africa.BEFORE you book, email them and ask if the Internet now works.  Maybe if they get 100 such emails the General Manger might get organised to FIX this simple issue.","Date of stay: January 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Perfectly comfortable chain experience","The Hilton Windhoek is very centrally located, with large-ish rooms, restaurants on site, a sky bar and an attached casino.  It serves its purpose very well - there is not a whole lot to do in Windhoek so it is more of a waypoint to the more interesting parts of Namibia - being very comfortable and familiar.  The Sky Bar seemed like a popular after work spot, with a great view of the city and outdoor pool.  On the night we stayed, there was a band performing in one of the restaurants (a local band that drew local residents - not a cheesy experience directly solely at tourists).  In short, there is enough there to keep you busy and comfortable for a short stay, particularly after a stay in the desert or other remote parts of Namibia.","Date of stay: February 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"TLC Required","Nice facility but we spot a training or service quality shortfall. For this Rated hotel one expect;1. Aprons and slip-on as well as wash cloth. We travelled light to join a camping group. Thought 2 nights in Hilton will make up for the camping adventure that lies ahead!2. Attention to detail such as the toilet paper. It seems a used roll was provided, just a simple fold will tell you its been attended to.3. Soap or shower cleaner spots...in blue... on the shower head give impression the cleaner did not get to the obvious spots... so what then about the not so obvious dirt.4. Toilet door does not close properly and about one cm of space between entrance door to floor. This clearly leaves a sounds problem into and from the room...privacy?5. Hanging space for wet towels...we want to save water so would like to dry towels for re-use...need a towel rail.6. No welcoming drink, sweet on pillow, flower, fruit or ice + water carafe in fridge...Namibia can be extremely hot. Any or all of the above can be achieved with just a bit of initiative...and TLC.

"Not brilliant but the best choice in Windhoek","The rooms are OK but ours were not particularly clean and the air con seemed to be regulated centrally and the rooms were far too warm. WLAN is only free of charge in public areas and you get access codes at the reception.   Food in the restaurant was OK but the Pizzas tasted the best.  Breakfast was Ok but service slow.  Nice sports bar and good beer but be prepared to get propositioned by the numerous prostitutes who sit there every evening.  As all areas of the hotel entrance  and the bar are monitored by big and numerous  video cameras I presume the prostitutes are tolerated by Hilton management.  There is an African street market just beside the hotel and prices there some 20% below the craft centre but the products are identical and you support local families by purchasing souvernirs at the street market.","Date of stay: June 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Stay at Hilton in Windhoek","My partner and I stayed at the Hilton on 9/10 December 2016.  The only dissapointment we had were the quality of the towels.  They were well worn and abrasive,  more like befitting a 1star hotel rather than a 5star hotel.  To the management please sort out the quality of your towels.","Date of stay: December 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Schlechtester Aufenthalt in Namibia","Auf ein Pre-Booked Zimmer 4 Stunden warten zu m√ºssen ist sogar f√ºr Afrika zu lange. Nach 2 Stunden wurden wir in die Lounge geschickt um nicht in der Lobby zu stehen. Leider gab es dort nicht mal was zu trinken. 2 Stunden sp√§ter sind wir nochmal runter, dann war das Zimmer fertig. Also hat man uns auch noch vergessen. Das ist f√ºr ein Hotel was 5Sterne beansprucht schon etwas schwach. ""We are sorry"" war alles... anscheinend kommt das √∂fter vor, da neben uns noch 2 weitere Paare in die Sitzecke( Lounge) zum Warten geschickt wurden. Auch am Abreisetag wo wir am Pool warteten sind ein paar Gruppen da rein.Bei der Abreise w√ºrde uns dann noch eine Internetgeb√ºhr f√ºr das W-LAN berechnet, das uns am Anreisetag zus√§tzlich zum Lobby WLAN explizit als Kostenlos angeboten wurde.Eine riesen Blamage f√ºr Hilton!Ansonsten ist das Hotel Ok. Zimmer und √∂ffentliche Bereiche etwas abgenutzt was aber f√ºr Afrika noch ok ist. Fr√ºhst√ºck ist das Beste an dem Haus. Passt zu 5Sterne.Sky Bar ist sehr sch√∂n. Leider √∂ffentlich zug√§nglich daher zum Sonnenuntergang voll.F√ºr Gesch√§ftsreisen OK, alles Andere ein No-Go!","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Een aangenaam verblijf gehad","Ik heb een week in dit hotel verbleven en was zeer tevreden.Checkin verliep zeer vlotjes. Had eerst een kamer langs een constructie site maar heb zonder probleem een andere kamer gekregen.De kamers zelf hier en daar een beetje afgeleefd maar nog steeds zeer ok. Het ontbijt is zeer goed en heb er elke morgen van genoten.Hebben zelfs een ontbijt-box ontvangen bij een vroeg vertrek.In het algemeen is het personeel super vriendelijk en zeer behulpzaam.Mis zeker de pool area en bar niet, aangenaam om te vertoeven.Zeer jammer is de te betalen wifi, in 2016 zou dit gerust gratis mogen zijn.Pluspunten: personeel, ontbijt, serviceMinpunten: wifi te betalen, dunne muren voor lawaai","Date of stay: April 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Probably best in Windoek but out of international Standards","I will say that it is a good choice while visiting Windoek. It deserves 5 stars for Namibia standards but 4 stars for European standards. No fresh orange juice, nothing special for breakfast and quite slow at front desk. A tip if you are gone to stay there is that you make your booking from Booking.com as if you done directly through Hilton it will cost you 30%.

Es ist noch immer ein sehr sch√∂nes Hotel, vor allem die tolle Dachterrasse mit Skybar und Pool l√§dt zum Entspannen ein. Die Zimmer sind sch√∂n und haben unheimlich komfortable Betten, allerdings hat die Sauberkeit nachgelassen. Im Zimmer liegt Teppichboden, auf dem ich leider einiges an Schmutz gefunden habe.

"Horrendous","If you have travelled even infrequently you will spot that this is a far cry from Hiltons elsewhere. It's a soulless, unloved, corporate hotel with bored and disinterested staff, service station food and a noisy bar that is busy with locals and pumps music loud and late. I had to remind myself, working through the incessant pump of the music, that I was paying to stay here. Good location, but that's all. Windhoek is tiny, stay elsewhere and travel two minutes longer.","Date of stay: April 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton Stay Dec 2014","I booked our stay at the Hilton in August 2014 and was really looking forward to 5* accommodation....to our disappointment.  The rooms we were allocated was not next to or even  close to each other...this after I had informed them that I have a 1.5 and 4yr old that would be sharing a room with my mother.On top of that - we get into Namibia at over 35"" heat and there is NO WATER in the rooms. When we called housekeeping - we were told that they were ""out of stock""....REALLY??????Hilton did try and make up for it by relocating us to a Superior room on another floor with the children closer, but the after taste of the supposedly 5* hasn't left...","Date of stay: December 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Only decent hotel in Windhoek","There are lots of nice guest houses in Windhoek where you can stay at a decent cost.  But since it opened a few years ago, the Hilton is really the only decent hotel -- better that the Windhoek Country Club (a bit out of the city), better than the Kalahari Sands (now a bit dated), and certainly better than the Safari Court (a bit of a dump).  I've stayed at the Hilton for a number of multiple week visits over the last few years. It's not perfect.  The service could be better in some ways, especially the cleaning of rooms.  But the Executive Lounge is quite pleasant, with a wonderful fellow by the name of 'Privilege' (seriously!) taking good care of you, and free drinks after 6 pm.  All in all, a nice hotel experience with better than average sized and modern rooms that are being adequately maintained.","Date of stay: October 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The rooms are nice, but the rooftop pool area is nicer","We stayed here our first night in Namibia as well as out last, and it's a lovely place. While it lacks the soul of a more established property, it's relatively new, convenient, and well-situated with good service. It's right near the center of town, so you can walk to restaurants, shops and cafes, and it's on the top of a hill, so you have great views of Windhoek from the rooms and rooftop pool. We truly enjoyed our hours sitting poolside soaking up the sun. And the front desk staff was particularly warm, helpful, and professional, especially Judy, Christiaan, and Brian. The property is off to a good start, and I'd highly recommend it as a comfortable place to stay.","Date of stay: March 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"One of the best Hilton Hotels in Africa","I stayed here in May and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the hotel. Rooms are brilliant and very modern with everything you need and comfortable beds. Since I only spent a night on business I didn't eat in the restaurants but I did meet people for drinks at the Sky Bar at the top of the hotel which has fantastic views over Windhoek and definitely the place for sundowners. The gym is well equipped and the executive bar and meeting area is well kitted out. Service was very good and the staff are friendly.The rates were very reasonable when compared to other hotels in the area which are far older, and it will definitely be my hotel of choice in Windhoek. I would rate it as in the Top 5 hotels on the African continent.","Date of stay: May 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A first-class experience","From arrival to departure all the staff went out of their way to be helpful and make you feel welcome.The hotel is spacious, spotless, and in a very central position in the City.The breakfast was one of the best I have experienced anywhere in the world, everything being fresh, the pastries, and rolls all warm. Stacks of fruits, and cereals.Hot dishes cooked to order. Something for everyone. Tables immaculateThe room was instantly welcoming, with large beds covered in pristine white linen. My only reservation was that the bathroom was open-plan (toilet enclosed and shower separate). My problem no doubt, but I'm a bit choosey about who I want to watch having a bath. But, it was all spotless.I watched with horror the way some of the guests behaved, fingers in the fruit salad bowl straight to the mouth, and they would no doubt blame the hotel if anything went wrong.I visit a lot of hotels around the world, and this is one of the best.","Date of stay: November 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The bed was large and comfortable and whilst in the city centre it was quiet. See separate report on dinner at the Epika restaurant. Breakfast in the same location was very good with great porridge, chopped fruit and an egg station.

"I love coming back...","After an exhausting flight from The Bahamas, it was wonderful having the hotel's transfer service (provided by Hertz) pick me up from the airport.Check-in/check-out were quick; Hilton team members were professional, polite and remembered me from my last couple of stays.I was also pleasantly surprised to have been chosen as guest of the day! I was in a rush to leave the following morning, so couldn't make use of the breakfast voucher/exec lounge access - but I did have a couple of complimentary nightcaps at the Sky Bar the night before.Thank you Benjamin and team...","Date of stay: November 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Below expectations","The hotel is well located in Windhoek. The staff in the reception area ,at the lifts and in the restaurant on the mezzanine floor are amazing but it all falls apart in the sky bar . There appear to be enough staff but they are very inefficient and the place is chaotic . I waited over an hour for a meal that was  very basic and it arrived cold . It took them 40 minutes to serve me a glass of wine that I had ordered on one occasion and 30 minutes on another occasion . There were many people experiencing the same problem . This is not the standard one would expect at a Hilton hotel .","Date of stay: October 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Die Zimmer sind gro√ü, sauber und modern ausgestattet mit traumhaften Betten. Die Reklamationsbew√§ltigung war nicht einem 5-Sterne-Haus angemessen, da haben wir uns doch sehr ge√§rgert.Was auf jeden Fall sehenswert ist: die Sky-Bar, Kleinigkeiten am Abend und man braucht das Hotel nicht mehr zu verlassen.

"Just okay","The Windhoek Hilton could be a far better hotel than it is, if only the front desk and concierge desks were better run.First of all, the good things:Wonderful room - I was upgraded to a suite because of my Diamond status.  The suite was huge and comfortable. Very, very good housekeeping staff.  Each day my room was cleaned to an immaculate condition. Executive Lounge Happy Hour was great.  Free drinks and extensive canap√©s. The staff in the Lounge, particularly the woman who greets people at the front desk, were extremely friendly and accommodating. The breakfast buffet in the main restaurant was quite good.  Extensive selection of foods.Now for the not so good:The concierge desk is a mess.  I wanted to book a tour to the Sossusvlei Dunes National Park (which, I was told, was the only tour available a day ahead of time) but I was whipsawed between one tour guide and the Hertz people who share the concierge desk.   It was very difficult to know which tour to take as full information was sorely lacking. No brochures at all are available. The Hilton should have one or two designated tour agencies with brochures - and the concierge staff should be trained in what tours are available.Check out was unpleasant.  One of the main flights to J'burg leaves at 6:30 am, so it‚Äôs necessary to get airport transport at 4:00.  When I arrived at the front desk at 3:45  to check out, there was no one there, and none of the bell hops knew where the attendant was.  He eventually showed up (and I have to admit he apologized) and I proceeded to check out.  But I wanted to get some change to pay the driver to the airport (as they purport never to carry change), but the front desk attendant said that no money was available as he had already deposited the money from the night before. He did offer the ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù suggestion that we could stop at a store on the way to the airport to get change.Finally, transport to the airport was chaotic even though there were very few people around.  This was largely because the concierge staff/ bell persons have no knowledge or take responsibility for anything. I had made arrangements to be picked up by a tour company driver.  However, the Hertz driver at the front door insisted that he was my driver.  I doubted this but he put my luggage in the Hertz van.  Then someone else came out from the hotel who HAD booked the Hertz driver and the driver said he could take us both.  I asked (again) whether he was sure he was my driver and he said yes.  At that moment a tour company driver arrived (it was a little after 4:00 am when my driver was supposed to arrive) who said he was my driver (and the bell staff agreed) and my luggage was transferred to his car.  We took off for the airport and were within 1 km of the departure area when the driver got a call that his real fare was waiting at the hotel and that he wasn‚Äôt my driver after all.  He actually turned around in the road and was going to go back to the city but because we were so close to the airport, I insisted that he take me there first.  All three arrangements for transport - the one Hertz guy, my tour company guy and the person who booked my actual car - had been arranged through the hotel.  The hotel staff needs to bring some order out of the arrangements for airport transportation, particularly early in the morning when no one seems to know anything about which cars are for which hotel guests.","Date of stay: July 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Top Lage, Executive Zimmer & Lounge sehr gut.","Wir haben wiederholt im Hilton √ºbernachtet, der Service war √ºberwiegend sehr gut, die Zimmer sind sauber und sehr gut ausgestattet, die Lage ist ideal.Das Restaurant k√∂nnte von der Speisequalit√§t her besser sein, aber es gibt ja au√üerhalb Alternativen.Z.B das neu er√∂ffnete Deli gegen√ºber hat leckere Mittagssnacks und Speisen, sowie wertvolle Lebensmittel (ein echter Tipp).Die Skybar lohnt zum Sundowner und der Pool auf dem Dach ist eine wohltuende Erfrischung - Aussicht inklusive.Nebenan wird gerade das Doubletree gebaut, wir haben jedoch keine Beeintr√§chtigung erfahren. Dennoch die Empfehlung: Zimmer mit Bergblick buchen, die sind zur anderen Seite.Besonders hervorheben m√∂chten wir den hervorragenden Service von Mr. Wilbert David, der gute Tipps und Infos zur Stadt f√ºr uns hatte und uns mit bestem Service in der Lounge beschenkt hat!

"Good Place to Stay","This was my first trip to Windhoek for many years. Since my previous visit, the Hilton had been built and I was very happy to stay there. I had room 804 on the eighth floor with access to the Executive Lounge.This was an very modern and very comfortable room. The quality of the furnishings and of the bathroom and bedroom were very high indeed. Inn fact, I would go so far to say that this was one of the best Hiltons I have stayed in for quite a while.For me it is the only place to stay in town. I was a little under the weather during my trip so did not really get to appreciate the rooftop pool or the rooftop bar. However, I expect to be returning to Windhoek in 2018 and I hope to address these two areas at some future point!","Date of stay: December 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Te duur en onder gangbare Hiltonnormen","We hadden gedacht onze Namibi√´reis te moeten beginnen in het enige Hiltonhotel in het land. Goed uitgerust na een lange vlucht beginnen aan een mooie rondreis. Dat viel wat tegen. De executive-kamer was ruim, maar niet overdadig schoon. Dat gold ook voor de badkamer, waar haren herinnerden aan eerdere passanten. Gelukkig was de badkamer in deze dure kamer niet geheel open en was de wc geplaatst achter een eigen glazen deur. Inchecken verliep niet vlot, personeel aan balie ( een werkend, twee toekijkend) was niet vriendelijk. Dat voor wifi per creditkaart betaald moet worden en dat dit later weer verrekend wordt is een vreemde gang van zaken, zeker als uiteindelijk een definitieve afrekening niet gegeven kan worden omdat de printer kapot is. Rare zaak, Hilton onwaardig. Vreemd was ook dat drie medewerkers voortdurend met de liften in de weer waren, maar dat vreemden zo via de trappen in het hotel konden. Het eten in de executivelounge was benedenmaats, zowel de karige snacks als het ontbijt. De bediening was niet bestaand. Hotel had een mooie bar en openluchtbad op bovenste verdieping, dat maakte veel, maar lang niet alles goed. Het hotel is van buiten architectonisch heel aardig, ligt centraal, met een parkeergarage ( beveilig en betaald) in de kelder, maar functioneert dik onder de gangbare Hiltonnormen.","Date of stay: November 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It seems that the clerks do not know how to use the computer. They printed out check-in paper work with wrong names and room numbers and had to manual wrote over them. There were only three lefts to the rooms. In the PM, one was working. The early morning checkout supervisor was the worse. I asked him to give me notes for the coins. He lied to me for having no money. When I found him lying he challenged me to report it to Hilton. The hotel entrance is awful; you have to climb the hill in and out. There are constructions next to Hotel. Watch out for nails. The good thing is that my room was okay. I would stay somewhere else next time.","Date of stay: April 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Overall great stay","We stayed at the Hilton after a week of camping and enjoyed the hotel time. The SkyBar pool area is lovely and felt very posh. I ordered two glasses of champagne for as it was my friend's birthday and the server brought over two shots with the drinks, which was a nice treat and considerate of him. We had a great dinner and fantastic service in the restaurant downstairs (Ekipa). The bathroom in our room was very open concept- I felt we had less privacy than out in the bush! Only the toilet has a closed door and the side of the shower is see through, so it required some rotations through the room for us all to have privacy. We had also booked online and requested a room with two beds- they didn't have one available for us and it took quite awhile for us to find a solution. We ended up having to wait for a room with two beds to be cleaned. They organized a shuttle to the airport which was helpful (although the driver was going 160km/h in the dark, so be comfortable to request a slower speed!).","Date of stay: March 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Arrogant Attitude of Front desk employees ","Arrived at hilton and busy checking in. We're told that we had only booked one Room and the hotel is fully booked front desk employees giving us very very bad attitude! After showing them confirmation of  booking for 2 rooms 2 nights they still did not care and said they don't have rooms available. absolutely discusting! we obviously did not step down because we had a booking confirmation and had paid. we asked to speak to the duty manager 6 times and eventually they took out a flip file to find the number/name of the duty manager. finally after 30 min asking to speak to the manager the security manager arrives which doesn't help us much. Even with confirmation and hilton messing us around for over an hour not apologising once or even offering us a water they suddenly had another room available. You Hilton Windhoek have wasted my time! Irritated and agitated me and really made me angry. you made me wait 1 hour for another room and I had to deal with unfriendly/bad attitude and arrogant front desk ladies! unacceptable for a hotel chain like hilton! the only reason you are getting 2 stars is because the following day the duty manager Amos came and apologised.  the first person that actually acknowledged that hilton windhoek messed up! thank you Amos.  house keeping was also very friendly and efficient. otherwise will I support hilton again in windhoek and around the world?

"Horrible service","The service was really terrible and they are giving Hilton a bad name. The front desk staff on check in were quite rude and very unprofessional. I suppose that's how they are because I saw the same thing happen to another guest who was checking in as I was checking out. I had asked for an executive room and was told the day before check in that it would be available for a fee which I was happy with but on the day it was a different story and they were quite rude about it. Service at the spa was as bad as the front desk. I had to find another spa to redo my nails because they were too embarrassing to go out in public with them. Bar service was no better, I had to wait 2 hours to pay for a drink that I couldn't even drink because it was so horrible and it never dawned on them to find out why I didn't drink it. It's such a shame that we got such bad service because the hotel is really nice.","Date of stay: January 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Probably the best stay in Windhoek","We felt safe and comfortable at the Windhoek Hilton. Very central location, great food and restaurant. The breakfast was definitely the best during our entire Namibia trip. And, with some interruptions, the wifi worked.The building site next door was a bit unfortunate but We understand things like that are an inevitable part of city life.We would stay here again on a next visit.","Date of stay: December 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"As good as any other Hilton","We have spend the first and the last night of our vacation at the Hilton Windhoek. The rooms are spacious (executive room) and we really enjoyed the roof top pool. The staff was very friendly and we would stay here again.There was just one I unpleased thing. The receptionist organized a taxi to a restaurant and told us the price would be around 70 NAD. When the driver arrived she talked to him and we paid the recommended price. On our way back the price was only 20 NAD. Both were registered taxis and from same quality.","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Amazing, luxurious hotel","I was in Windhoek on business for a week and couldn't be happier with the Hilton.  It feels luxurious from the moment you walk in.  The rooms are large with big beautiful bathtubs and very comfortable beds.  The service is amazing and the food delicious (although they could use less salt in their dinners!).  TI especially liked the breakfast.  he rooftop is very special and I spent many nights up there.I will definitely be returning next time I am in Windhoek.However if I am in Windhoek next time for much longer than a week I will need to send my laundry out as the laundry service prices are astronomical.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Many. Problems. Always.","It's the second time I stay there on business trips. It's a big property, with a cool top floor sky bar, very nice rooms, good restaurants and probably the best breakfast in town. But the pluses end there.Service is weird. They make an effort to be pleasant, but always mess things up. Staff seems to be always new, probably high turn over. The first time I stayed there was bad. Dismissive lady at reception said our rooms were not ready and couldn't tell us when they would be. They lost our clothes in the laundry (and never found them and offered no compensation or explanation). I decided to give it another chance this week, and oh boy did I regret it. They forgot my wake up call in the morning and I almost missed an appointment. I ordered the soup of the day and they took 1h and 15 minutes to deliver.","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Gutes Hotel in zentraler Lage von Windhoek","Wir bekamen ein Zimmer im 2. Stock. Bis auf das Sofa, das viele Gebrauchsspuren hatte, war alles sauber und ordentlich. Das Bad ist offen gestaltet mit Regendusche und Badewanne, WC separat. Die Betten waren bequem. Als am 2. Tag vergessen wurde frische Handt√ºcher hinzuh√§ngen, wurde dies sofort nachgeholt und mit 2 Flaschen Wasser und etwas Schokolade als Wiedergutmachung erledigt. Das Parkhaus ist f√ºr einen SUV etwas eng und kostet extra. WLAN funktioniert gut. Die Skybar mit Ausblick ist toll. Empfehlen k√∂nnen wir auch die ""local-is-lekker"" Aktion im Restaurant. Dort werden typisch Namibische Speisen in Buffettform dargereicht. (Inkl. Mopane-Raumen, getrocknetem Huhn, Malipap..) Auch das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffett ist sehr reichhaltig und lecker. In Sachen Reisetipps sollten die Mitarbeiter allerdings noch besser geschult werden. Auf unsere Fragen (z.B. wo es die Permits f√ºr Nationalparks gibt) konnte keine Antwort gegeben werden. Leider hat man es auch vers√§umt uns dann einfach zur direkt neben dem Hotel liegenden Touristeninfo zu verweisen.","Date of stay: May 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"THE premier Windhoek hotel!","Stayed in Windhoek on business in June, 2016. The Windhoek Hilton can hold its own against any other US base Hilton hotels. Extremely pleased with the quality of the hotel and service mindedness of the staff. I'm actually trying to think of something to be upset with and in struggling. The wifi connection, that has to be it... It connects easily enough, but I repeatedly lost connection having to go through it all over again. Petty, I know, but that was the only issue I had for a week, but it was a continuous problem! But this is Namibia... having worked here on and off for 5 years I can say the Internet reliability varies, so in all honesty this may not be Hilton Windhoek's fault.","Date of stay: June 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not Inspired - motel room in the sky","Hilton business hotels world-wide are pretty much the same and Windhoek didn't disappoint in that regard reminding me how dull some hotels can be in just being motel rooms in the sky. From a purely sleep perspective - the Hilton Windhoek was comfortable - clean sheets yay!; From a food aspect - breakfast was delicious giving a good choice with fresh options; From a service point - not so personal; From an inspirational level - pretty uneventful with limited views and pinned windows - although the view from the roof top bar was lovely across Windhoek but it was something of a pickup bar for the lost and lonely.  Condom packets in the bedside table draws confirmed the fears.  Still, we flew in late and left the hotel early and I was thinking comfortable bed. I was hoping it might have had a Windhoek flavour and I was happy to find Windhoek had a better flavour than the one I found at the Hilton Windhoek.  Suffice to say I wasn't inspired by the Hilton Windhoek - I am just not into business hotels.","Date of stay: January 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Horrible service at a mediocre hotel at best","The service is horrible. They do not answer e-mails, made a big fuss about reserving a dinner table at the resturant where the food that night was expensive, boring and less inspiring than a week long lecture on ""stamp history from the early 1900s"".The hotel itself is more three star than five stars and the pool is tiny - and that's if your ""lucky"" and the pool is open.

"Breakfast disaster  but okish overall","Stayed there for two nights, Check in was effortless . got a room on the 1st floor right next to the construction site. the thumping of a jack hammer even at 14h00 in the afternoon was too much to bear. Requested another room and was accommodated immediately on the 6 th floor. Asked for two shirts to be valet , was informed that eh machine was broken . asked if it could be ironed, was told yes and had to wait for two hours and only after numerous calls to housekeeping eventually got my semi ironed shirts back( Not good at all). Had a good nights sleep . on the 6th floor sleep quality is excellent.  On the check out morning at breakfast I found some hair in the scrambled eggs that I dished needless to say that spoiled my whole breakfast. Although the Chef de partie did apologise  breakfast was still ruined . And for some one who intends to sign a long term agreement they will have to do a lot more to convince me that they should be the Company's hotel of choice.","Date of stay: November 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Se la persona che dorme e non √® un businessman , risulta assai scocciante sentire suonare il campanello degli ascensori ad ogni passaggio al piano a partire dalle 5,30 del mattino.

"The only real 5 star option in town","Stayed a week on business.Overall a comfortable stay in this hotel which is a good location. This is a quiet city with limited hotel options so this is your best choice.The good - nice well appointed rooms, spacious which meets the needs of a business traveler. Good location, pleasant staff, nice rooftop bar.What can improve - the elevators were a constant problem and needs to be addressed, the hotel know about this but the solution is not evident. The gym is on the rooftop but the two treadmills were not working. It also is a bit small and stuffy for a gym. Enjoyed the stay despite these small issues. Some tips for travelers:- take taxis from the hotel to get around- try some good restaurants for wonderful charm and food 1) Stellenbosch 2) Joe's beerhouse 3) Sardinia's Blue Olive. The first was the best, and the meats are fabulous. For daytime work meals try Gourmet in the hear of the city, which is a piece of Austria, and charming.","Date of stay: May 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Excellent","Stayed here on business for two weeks. Prior to my arrival (2 weeks) I had difficulty communicating with this hotel regarding my reservation, emails (contact details taken from Hilton website) went unanswered and calls were ineffective. On arrival there was no record of my reservation but then the genuinely friendly staff resolved the issues and things got much better. Rooms are clean, well equiped and up to date, good selection of TV channels, wifi good (but only because I dont have to pay for it).This is the best breakfast I've experienced at a Hilton - faultless with a great range of items and the unique fresh smoothie service was an unexpected bonus. The service in the roof top lounge was excellent even though its on the small side. As a Diamond member I was disapointed not to have received a room upgrade even though rooms were available. Hotel has a taxi service to/from the airport which takes around 45mins though it's not free.

We were very pleased to have such a good start in Namibia.","Date of stay: January 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A high standard Hilton","We stayed here twice in a one week trip to Namibia.  The rooms were of a high standard, comfortable and clean.  We ate in the restaurant three times and on each occasion the food was of a high standard.  On each occasion one of the Chefs came and spoje to us.  The staff were efficient, friendly and helpful.  The service in the Kalibar was the only thing that let the hotel down. There was always one efficient and friendly waiter who seemed to be doing all the work, the rest of the staff seemed to be treating work as an extension of their social life with more focus on chatting to each other than on serving customers. This is a management and training issue.  I would stay here again.","Date of stay: January 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Guter Startpunkt f√ºr Namibia","Wir sind mit der Abendmaschine in Windhoek gelandet und haben die ersten N√§chte in Nambia im Hilton verbracht. Die Fahrt vom Flughafen dauert ca. 30 Minuten.Leider stand das eigentlich gebuchte Raucherzimmer nicht zur Verf√ºgung, aber das konnten wir dann direkt am n√§chsten Tag beziehen. Freundliche Aufmerksamkeit des Managements in Form von hausgemachten Pralinen auf dem Tisch im Zimmer. Sehr lecker! Das Bad ist sehr gro√üz√ºgig gestattet, allerdings in den eigentlichen Raum integriert. Dusche und Wanne getrennt. Die Dusche hat sowohl einen Regenwaldkopf, als auch eine Handbrause. Uns hat das sehr gut gefallen, anderen fehlt vielleicht ein wenig Intimsph√§re - die aber auf dem WC definitiv gew√§hrleistet ist. Das Zimmer ist ger√§umig, das Bett sehr bequem. Safe, internationales TV (auch ARD und ZDF), Klimaanlage, Kaffee- und Teezubereitung sowie Minibar vorhanden. Handt√ºcher, Bademantel und Hausschuhe sind zwar eigentlich vorhanden, allerdings nicht immer in ausreichender Zahl. Auf Nachfrage bekommt man alles, aber eigentlich sollte das bei einem Hilton nicht erforderlich sein.Die Einrichtungen des Hotels sind auch sehr sch√∂n. Rooftop-Pool & Bar mit Blick √ºber Windhoek laden zum Entspannen ein. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist hervorragend - alles was das Herz und die H√ºfte begehrt. Einzig der Kaffeeservice ist etwas schleppend und k√∂nnte etwas aufmerksamer sein. Die Backwaren, die Smoothie-Station und die Omelette-Zubereitung sind dagegen hervorragend!  Die Lage des Hilton ist absolut zentral, man kann alle Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten problemlos zu Fu√ü erreichen.W-Lan in der Lobby kostenlos verf√ºgbar. Man muss sich nur einen Code an der Rezeption holen, dann bekommt man 8 Stunden Zugriff gew√§hrt. Danach wird ein neuer Code ben√∂tigt.Wir w√ºrden bei unserem n√§chsten Besuch wieder dort unsere Reise beginnen.","Date of stay: November 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Loved my stay - great Hilton property","Stayed for ten days while on a business trip and would absolutely return to this great Hilton property. Great rooms - comfortable and clean with nice decor. Loved they layout of the hotel from the open spaces/lobby to the rooftop pool/bar area with beautiful views of Windhoek. The breakfast buffet is fantastic and the standout of all the evening buffets and restaurant offerings. There is such a great variety of breads, cooked to order eggs, cereals, fruit, fresh squeezed juices etc. The other buffets are fine but the breakfast is the star with great service. Prices at the restaurants and bars are not outrageous. A couple of my colleagues enjoyed and raved about the massages they had at the spa - also on the roof top - and also well priced. Concierge and other service staff were always helpful. The rooftop Sky bar has quickly become the trendy hang out place on weekend nights and can be a little loud but some people like this!Two small points of concern - the glasses and mugs in the rooms were cleaned every day but with what I do not know as they had such a strong chemical smell each time. Much has been written about house cleaning staff  using  products other than soap and water to clean and I suspect this is true here. I noted this on my evaluation and received an immediate response apologizing for this. I would hope this can be remedied. Finally there were small inconsistencies that my colleagues and I experienced in our rooms - some would receive a free bottle of water and a chocolate/turn down service in the evening on some days and not on others - and one never received the chocolate and turn down service. Obviously not a big deal in light of my overall experience.. Other than this no complaints and loved my stay and wish I was back in warm, sunny Namibia as I write this!","Date of stay: November 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Bad Transport and Terrible Bathroom for Father and Daughter","Please absolutely do not use Hilton Windhoek. There was bad service from the start. Our confirmed airport transfer did not arrive and we had to ward off people trying to put us in their cars instead. How would you feel when you arrive in a strange land and the first thing start going wrong!??Secondly, when our car finally arrived after umpteen calls at 30 mins, luckily their transportation sub-contractor had another driver there, picking up someone else. Through their rearrangement to send his own guest to Hilton as well, Mr. Driver sent us to Hilton.In the car, you start to feel unsafe as there are cracks and crooks on the wind screen. With the constant hitting on this stony road from the airport, the wind screen would just fall onto Mr. Driver and my father sitting infront. They sent their drivers and guests around in unsafe calls? Had and should always go super slow in order to reduce the effect of the hitting.When we reached the hotel, we asked to speak to the in-charge. The second in-charge finally appeared without even handing us his namecard, gave a few words to Mr. Driver and just left us alone after giving us his nonchalant attitude and words.The third worst thing, their front-desk service was not warm at all. Thus, infuriating the already-upset-me.Fourth terrible-experience point, Hilton's bathroom are the stupidest whether it is in Sydney or Windhoek, there is a see-through slab at the side of the bathroom?????? The rest of the bathroom was very translucent as well!!!When I have my shower, my father has to wait at the restaurant. What nonsense is this!!My conclusion - no more Hiltons for us.

"Perfect Hilton service, but without african atmosphere.","Perfect in many ways, and right in the city centre.  Relaxed atmosphere (first Hilton I've been where I feel I fit in even I wear fleece sweater and sneakers). We had breakfast, made use of in-room dining and the coffee shop, and felt we got value for money (but we also live in Norway where everything is very expensive). The pool area was quite windy sometimes, but we also stayed at the hotel during the Namibian winter (which is short). We got anyway a short dip in the pool which is 28 Celsius. The hotel is quite new and everything is what you expect of a Hilton hotel. As you can see from pictures, the bathrooms have a very ""open solution"", so think careful who you want to share you room with :). The best part is anyway the staff who are very friendly and perceptive. Many tourists use the hotel as a first or last stop in Namibia. If you feel you want some affordable comfort before or after a round trip in the country, then I can highly recommend the hotel. But if you seek a more local African atmosphere, you might should consider a good guest house in the suburbs, or guest farm outside the city. Even the price quickly can be the same if you want same comfort and service as Hilton offers.  Hilton offers airport transfer at scheduled departure times via Vulkan Ruin Tours & Transfers for 150 ZAR/NS per person one way, or private car with flexible departure times for 180 ZAR/NS (ask concierge). We used the private solution and here they didn't charge us for our 7 year old child. Book the day before to get sure you get the departure time you want.","Date of stay: August 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Overall, it can be hard to find good service in Namibia (with some very notable exceptions), but without fail I found the staff helpful with a number of issues.

"Excellent choice for a touch of luxury and central location","I would not normally opt for a hotel in the centre of Windhoek but would rather head out to the suburbs to a cheaper and comfortable guest house. On this occasion, I booked the Hilton for our last night before flying back home after a long driving holiday around Namibia, I'm pleased I did! I booked the rooms well in advance and got an extremely good advance rate which was not much more than an average B&B. The hotels is new and that is echoed throughout, the rooms are very spacious with great views of Windhoek, beds extremely comfortable and the breakfast very, very good with great service. There was lots of underground parking for the Toyota Hylux we had and the staff were very helpful assisting us gather out lives together and get to reception and our rooms (I was a little surprised we had to pay 60 dollars to park there, very strange for such a big hotel!). If you are not a couple I would be careful in selecting your room, ours was a twin double but the bathroom (bath, sink and shower) is open plan (I have to say it was the best bath I have taken in years!). We all slept very well and the location was great for a quick wander in the morning up to the Parliament Buildings and garden before heading off.If you are finishing a trip and after a bit of luxury and a very good nights sleep before flying out I would recommend it (a little fancy but hey once in a while I can cope :-) ). Service was very formal but courteous.Excellent","Date of stay: November 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The only hotel to stay at in Windhoek","This hotel beats any in Windhoek and IS the hotel of choice for tourists, business people and locals. Well set out, sharp design, staff willing to assist, efficiently run, not sterile, nice atmosphere, conveniently and centrally located. Reasonable rates, booking made online.Arrival - easy, efficient check-in, nice welcome, good assistance with hire vehicle and parking, explanation of where breakfast is served, location of the sports bar, where the lifts were, discussion as to what floor level our room was and our intended checkout time.Accommodation - large and spacious room, queen size bed, comfy, nice linen, separate bath, shower, loo and washbasin area, hair dryer, power points for recharging, desk with chair, occasional chair, large flat screen TV, minibar (well stocked), safe, coffee/tea facilitiesFood - Dinner was offered in the Ekipa Restaurant either al a carte (limited and small menu with grill options also) or the buffet. We chose the buffet which was really good quality and great selection. Glance at the buffet before deciding, you should not be disappointed. Wine list had a good range available. Staff during dinner were attentive, friendly, and kept themselves busy. Breakfast is served in the same location as the Ekipa Restaurant. Food quality and buffet selection was good but during our visit we experienced sleepy, sloppy service - harmless though (its just breakfast really!) and would not deter us from recommending this hotel to others.Reservations - Book directly with hotel via website, online, instant confirmation, secure credit card system, great prices and options offered.Facilities - comfortable lounge areas on the ground level (indoor and outdoor), shade provided outside. Toilet facilities on the ground and mezzanine level. Small shop (cigarettes, postcards, lollies) on mezzanine level near lifts. Curio shop on ground level with good selection of gifts, jewellery, t-shirts cds etc and staff were efficient here. Sports bar had a great vibe, TV screens, staff were attentive, also comfy indoor and outdoor seating (plus heaters). A separate wine cellar room is near the sports bar and looked well stocked and intimate, would suit private meetings or functions.Best - dinner buffet (quality of food and service received), sports bar (atmosphere and service received) and the room overall. Check-out was 12.00pm - fantastic! The night manager Pieter went above and beyond to deliver a special dessert platter to us, with a lovely message - thank you!Improvements - lack of rubbish bins in room (we only had one tiny bin in the actual loo area) and offer complimentary water for cautious tourists.Verdict - The only hotel to stay at in Windhoek!","Date of stay: June 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton is Hilton...","Five star hotel in Windhoek. Staff was friendly and helpfull. Rooms were clean and well equiped. Lack of a bottle opener was not a problem for a room service. lol....We spent all together three nights in this hotel. Breakfast buffet was exelent. Enough for a dayBut remember, don`t ever order your transportation to airport at the front desk. It`s three times expensive than a taxi, and it`s not a limo.","Date of stay: July 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Chic style in Namibia?","If you are looking for an Africa experience, skip it. But it you want a true 4 star westernized-urban business-like hotel in downtown Windhoek then go for it. Did this whole place just drop into Namibia? Very lovely modern setting, room decoration is strange with bathtub open to the whole room. Roof top deck is fantastic, but small.  BEWARE of flaky wifi service that only works in some seats in the lobby, does not work in the rooms or roof top deck. Internet in the room is plug in...no plug on an iPad or smart phone so worthless for me. And they charge for internet access - annoying.","Date of stay: July 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good choice in Windhoek","The hotel is centrally located with a range of sights nearby. We stayed in the very large presidential suite. The suite was generously furnished with lots of lovely decorative items. The bathroom was spacious with all amenities one can think of. The lounge is rather small but has everything you need with a good buffet breakfast and free flow in the evening hours. Service staff is very friendly and helpful. There is a fantastic view from the lounge. The rooftop pool is great as well as the rooftop bar with a great vibe, especially in the evening when you have the best view of Windhoek by night. Hotel staff is friendly and professional.","Date of stay: May 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great Overnight Stays","We overnighted at the Hilton at the start and the end of a 12 day tour of Namibia with the excellent Wild Wind Safaris. This ensured we had a good rest after long flights prior to starting our tour. We were especially pleased to be upgraded to the Executive rooms as gold members. Service was excellent and all staff were friendly and helpful. We are very happy to recommend this hotel.","Date of stay: September 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Average ","The staff are very friendly and helpful.The rooms need to be updated and could do with a proper clean. There was dirt splattered on the walls and roof, the linen had stains and the furniture is damaged. The breakfast is dead average.Other than that the sky bar and pool is nice and it is located near all the tourist attractions.","Date of stay: January 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lovely hotel with a killer rooftop bar","We were upgraded to a garden room on the 7th (executive) floor. Lovely room with a terrace. Though we booked for two adults and a child, they didn't provide anywhere for the child to sleep - but we were only there one night so he just jumped in bed with us.The executive lounge on the 9th floor is characterless and hot. Horrible place with dated decor. And very strict about what you can have at what times. We arrived 5 minutes after they put away the snacks but 55 minutes too early for supper. So there was nothing to eat. Host just shrugged.Beers and wine were locked away for another 55 minutes too apparently. Had a coke and went outside (though not allowed to take your coke outside either). Wonderful rooftop bar with slow service. Pool available. Not heated so pretty cold in the winter. The spa was closed for redecoration. Views from the roof are nice - great place for some sundowners.Parking garage beneath the hotel. You are supposed to pay for this so keep your receipt that you get when you enter it. We lost ours.The main restaurant was ok. Food was not bad but nothing to write home about. Breakfast was nice.Staff were all friendly, and overall a good place for a stopover.","Date of stay: July 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A very solid choice","I stayed in the Hilton for six nights. Overall this hotel is a very solid choice. The room was large and comfortable with most of the core amenities. It could be improved by stocking the mini bar, adding some bath robes and a hairdryer. The breakfast has a decent buffet with an omelette station. The staff are friendly and helpful. It is well located - with the Supreme Court building across the road and several banks nearby. The gym has a couple of running machines, a cycle and two cross trainers. There‚Äôs a small selection of free weights. The swimming pool is a bit incidental. There is also the sky bar which offers a good view across the city.","Date of stay: July 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good choice for a few nights in Windhoek","Most people don't spend long in Windhoek.  It's not the most exciting city nor the most safest.  I spent a few nights here after travelling around Namibia.  There are not that many 4 or 5 star options in the area and I wanted something with a bit of nightlife within the hotel.  Normally I would go out but as I said Windhoek has limited options with regards to this.  This was a good choice to relax after a hectic trip but at the same time I could do some local sightseeing and last minute shopping.  Nice room.  Spacious and clean.  Close to some attractions and eateries.  The hotel has some good dining options itself.  Big lobby.  Nice atmosphere.  Secure.  Staff are pleasant.  Prior to my trip around Namibia, I spent a night in another hotel in Windhoek which was more a luxury lodge.  This was also nice but very isolated and more for people who wanted total peace.  After being on safari in lodges and guest houses, I was quite glad to get back to the city and the Hilton was a good choice.  Would recommend.","Date of stay: March 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lovely, modern hotel","A lovely hotel, centrally located in Windhoek. Modern, and lovely roof top bar and small swimming pool. Rooms are spacious, with a well sized bathroom, with separate bath and shower. Bed is comfy, my only complaint was noise insulation. Whilst not excessive, I did hear some road noise and the couple next door. Good aircon and reasonable wifi.Breakfast was ok, but not the usual Hilton standard.","Date of stay: September 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good stay but inconsistent service","A comfortable modern hotel in a great central location. The rooms are large and comfortable with all amenities one would expect. My bathroom was well fitted with a shower and bath with a separate toilet, the bathroom did however open on to the room so no privacy if it was desired. The internet connection in the room was good. Breakfast was great, good range of hot and cold food. The buffet for dinner was also pretty good. The service at all times in the restaurant was however pretty slack, we often had to wait to get someone's attention and had to ask for things that you would expect to be anticipated, such as coffee at breakfast.Only disappointment of the four night stay was room service one evening. On two nights I ordered a steak, the same steak, the first night the steak was significantly larger the on the second. I was also given different  side dishes to what I ordered, even after the person who took my order repeated it back to me.Reception staff were very helpful, organising transfers and an excursion when I had some free time.Would recommend the hotel and would stay again.","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Absolutes Spitzenhotel - sehr empfehlenswert","Wir waren bereits das zweite Mal als Familie im Hilton Windhuk und waren auch diesmal von dem Hotel, der Freundlichkeit und Hilfsbereitschaft der Angestellten sehr angetan. Der ideale Platz f√ºr die Ankunft in Namibia bevor es auf Rundreise geht. Absolut familienfreundlich, sehr um das Wohlergehen der G√§ste bem√ºht und sehr aufmerksam. Die Zimmer sind sehr sch√∂n und modern eingerichtet und bieten genug Platz f√ºr gross und klein. Die Lage des Hotels ist f√ºr Ausfl√ºge zu den Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten der Stadt ideal. Unbedingt das Pool auf dem Dach ausprobieren, schwimmen mit diesem Ausblick, sensationell.

"Hit and miss....","I stayed twice in the past month, from Jan 14-18 and again Jan 25-29. THE GOODCheck-In:Was friendly and efficient. I was very fortunate to be upgraded both times. The Room:I was on Level 8 and the rooms were fine. The curtains blocked out any light when closed so great for sleeping. A good size and nice views from my high-floor.The Bathroom: It's open plan and fine if you are a single traveller or a couple. If you are 2 friends traveling together and not sharing a bed, the bathroom lacks any privacy. Towels are large and fresh every day and the usual Hilton toiletries, although they did tend to skimp a bit with them. Soap is obviously in short supply, as is Conditioner. The Bed:Nice king bed in this room and was reasonably comfortable. Comfort-o-meter: 6.5/10. Clean linens and duvee, 4 pillows, soft. I did order foam pillows but that didn't happen. But no big deal. TV:Is a 36"" LG TV's in the room with ample choice of English, German, Afrikaan and local channels. Lots of good sports channels too.Room Facilities: A large bottle of still water is supplied daily ( a necessity because the colour of the water coming out of the tap was suspicious ). Also tea and coffee making with a nice choice of teas. Milk is the small containers of long-life liquid, much better than powdered chemicals. But do yourself a favour and bring your own milk and water. There is a mini bar with the usual offerings. Dining / Room Service:Was excellent and very reasonably priced. The food quality was good and the service with a smile was always nice. And quick. Executive Lounge: I have mixed feelings about the Lounge. The staff are fantastic, the food offering is as good as any Hilton I have stayed, from lamb to chicken to seafood along with cheeses, and a great varity of wines and beers and liquors. I indulged in Ballantines more ofen than not. The lounge itself is over 2 floors. I didn't go upstairs. But downstairs there is not enough seating. I think it needs a rethink with better seating arrangements. It was 3 lounge areas. Sometimes in a lounge one needs to sit quietly and work but you cannot do it here because you are always sharing a sofa with a stranger. I am also a bit of a stickler for dress codes. Here, German women parading around in the skimpiest of shorts, or their sweaty gym gear, leaving nothing to the imagination. I'm all for seeing women in skimpy shorts to be honest, but not in the Executive lounge. I thought Exec Lounges were a place for people to relax and work and have a drink. Anyway, call me old fashioned I guess. The staff: Very high standards ( the main restaurant downstairs was hit & miss ) but that was the exception. Everyone else was very helpful, smiling, and seemed to be enjoying themselves. The team in the Exec Lounge were a cut above the rest. Very friendly and courteous. The Location: Situated in downtown area, the location is ideal. You can park under the hotel for a very modest daily fee. It's an easy walk to some of the local restaurants and supermarkets and local arts and crafts stores. Beware of pick-pockets though. The place is rampant with them. Just be careful if venturing out on foot. Hotel Facilities: There is a fantastic bar on Level 9 with a lap pool. It has nice views overlooking parts of Windhoek. The gym is on this floor too and is adequate. There are a number of restaurants in the Lobby area and a bar. The bar is interesting to say the least with quite pushy ladies of the night. Let's leave it at that. Security did nothing about it making me think commission is a possibility.THE NOT SO GOODBreakfast:I took breakfast in th Executive Lounge a few times and other times in the main restaurant. Neither was particulary good to be frank. Very little choice in the Executive Lounge and the problem of no where to sit if there are more than half dozen people in the Lounge at the same time. In the main restaurant, the buffet was a bit of a mess, the staff look disinterested in service. Housekeeping: Very hit and miss. I wanted bed linen changed on only one of the 4 days and was told they had run out that day and could I wait until tomorrow. I did. But it never happened. I usually do the 3 day thing ( you know, saving the plant, global warming, environment, climate change blah blah blah ) but this time they had run out of sheets and slips. And I never had enough soap or shampoos. It was a bit frustrating to be honest. I didn't bother asking for more. Wi-Fi:Very bad. Slow slow slow. But they are improving and upgrading I was told, so hopefully when you visit after March 1st the speeds will resemble normal civilised world standards. But to not be able to even have a simple email download under a minute is a bit poor. And at the tim of my stays, there is no Premium wi-fi for Diamond members. SummaryI think the good things about this Hilton outweigh the not so good. The staff make or break any hotel and here they are very good ( except in restaurant ).Would I stay Again: Hard to say. As a Hilton Honors Diamond the answer is probably yes because of the benefits. There is a new Hilton Garden Inn being built next door, owned by the same Chinese owners. I will probably take a look at that place next time I come.Would I recommend: Sure, why not. Just don't expect too much. But it's an OK, average Hilton.","Date of stay: January 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First Hilton experience, not worth returning.","Arrived at the Windhoek Hilton on Feb 17th. The staff were quick to greet us at the front door and grab our luggage. The front entrance and lobby were really beautiful. That is where the good impression ended.  Our reservation, booked and paid for months ago was nowhere to be found. We were finally assigned room 211.  The room looked quite nice with the exception of the shower. The cover plate for one of the taps was missing. Minor detail but not something you would expect from the Hilton brand. The minibar was also half empty so we had to call room service to get it filled. Not sure how they bill for items if it's not being checked/restocked in between guests. My travel companion spent the $20 for 24 hours of wifi. Incredibly overpriced to begin with so the frustration mounts when it's unreliable. She spent 2 hours on the phone with the IT department to get it working properly. Totally unacceptable. Further to that, there were charges for phonecalls to the IT department that we had to dispute on checkout.During our stay we were browsing the gift shop. My companion brushed her leg up against the corner of a counter. A chipped glass shelf sliced through her pants and into her knee.  She was bleeding all over the floor. The employee just stood there, we had to ask for a cloth or paper towel to slow the bleeding. All she had was toilet paper so I had to run to the front desk to ask for something else. The front desk supervisor came to the gift shop and said a few words to the other employee then left.  At no point did anyone ask how she was, ask if we needed anything or if they could call anyone. We made our way to the hospital where she received sutures. The broken shelf was still in place when we returned and the next morning before we left so clearly they were not concerned about the injury whatsoever. The shower the morning of checkout was also ridiculous. The water pressure was poor to begin with but mid shower the pressure kept dropping until the water shut off all together. The front desk was notified and said they would get someone to work on it. Eventually we discovered the cold water was still working but of course that is less than ideal. I stood in the shower for 10 mins and finally moved back to bed to warm up. My hair was full of shampoo so I couldnt dry off and get dressed.  After 45 mins and worried I was going to leave late to the airport I finished my shower with cold water. We stopped at the front desk on the way out to ensure any additional charges were dealt with so our guide didn't get stuck with anything inappropriate. As mentioned above, there were charges for the internet and calls to the IT department which all were voided.  We had also ordered a bottle of wine and I explained the shower situation and said they could at least comp the bottle for my trouble. They ignored me completely until I spoke up and brought the cold shower to their attention again. I got attitude from from the clerk at that point. She asked if I told anyone about the cold shower. In fact, my companion made 2 calls and our guide also went directly to the front desk after I notified him of the problem. They eventually agreed to void the charges for the wine.I will add that the breakfast buffet was quite good. Had a great selection and made to order options. I would hope that this property was just having an off day during our stay but from my perspective the staff are either poorly trained or completely indifferent. Perhaps a combination of the two.  I had never stayed at Hilton property before and was so looking forward to my first experience.  Unfortunately it was incredibly disappointing.  Maybe one day I'll try a Hilton again but not anytime soon.","Date of stay: February 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Staff very friendly, executive lounge great service and food although the lounge is very small and closed in, no sunset views only from roof top pool same floor. The rooms need new mattresses and furniture.  Although very clean the chair and ottoman was old, dirty stained and marked.  Mattress was hard and old , not up to Hilton mattress standards.

"hotel with pluses and minuses","we booked this hotel for the beginning and end of our stay while visiting namibia.  due to bad weather we were not able to catch our connector flight and couldn't make it for our stay at the hilton. i emailed them right away with much notice hoping to cancel but didn't get any reply from them.  on our stay at the end of the trip, the front desk didn't give me any help on any action that was taken from maybe cancelling my first night.  they said that they would contact me later, and i'm still waiting after 1 month.  check in was good, the rooms are nice and comfortable.  the pool upstairs is small but sufficient.  the gym was small and some of the equipement didn't work very well.  we tried to book massages at the spa but they were all booked up. we had pizza and wings at the bar that was pretty good.  all i wanted to drink was water and the bartender was not happy and said that i was using all her glasses.  i think the best part of this hotel was the breakfast. wide selection of foods and they were delicious.  they even had a juicer that made fresh juice in the morning.  the funny thing about this hotel is trying to find the best way to get to the airport.  no one could really tell me and everyone had a different recommendation and the prices were everywhere.  i found the cheapest to be the hertz rental car in the front of the hotel, they will give you transport to the airport.  the taxis were more expensive. at times i found the front desk people almost had some conflict of interest of who they want you take the transport from.  also i asked the front desk where i could visit and if its safe. they said not safe, and nothing to see! (still daylight) don't go outside.  overall nice hotel, bad customer service.","Date of stay: January 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"International hotel in a nice location","The location of the Hilton Windhoek is great. The staff at the reception and the door man are very friendly and helpful, however the daily room cleaning in the morning was too slow and took until the afternoon, even after having complained twice. The snack at the roof top bar was nice and of good quality. The shower in the bathroom should really have a door in front of the shower. Even after showering very careful, the floor is wet, very slippery and therefore really dangerous, since the door to the shower is missing.","Date of stay: July 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Outstanding","This Hilton is up to the standard of any city Hilton anywhere in the world. It is faultless. We were really concerned about staying here after such negative reviews but we really didn't need to be.Firstly, the rooms are spotless, modern, big and comfortable. The beds are excellent. The bathroom is huge and so clean. You have a safe, fridge, tv, hairdryer etc all as expected.There are a few dining options in the hotel including a sushi and wine bar which we didn't try out. However, we did use the sky bar on the roof on level 9 for a sundowner. I'm so pleased we did. It was breathtaking to see Windhoek at night against the African sky. Kids are allowed at the Sky bar and there is a great selection of non-alcoholic and alcoholic cocktails as well as all the typical bar fare. There was a small pool menu at the Sky bar too (pool is on the roof) but we chose to eat at the main restaurant and I'm so pleased we did! It was cook yourself buffet night and the chefs invited us along with our own chef hats in to the kitchen to choose our own food which they then cooked to your specification. The chefs were fantastic, so friendly and keen to help you. It was an amazing experience for our daughter and whoever thought up the idea should be highly congratulated. I heard such negative reviews about the restaurant but this showed it has been massively turned around. Breakfast was equally excellent with a huge selection of options and really good value for a Hilton breakfast. The only negative in the restaurant at both dinner and breakfast was the waitress team who are quite frosty towards us and mega slow.The concierge team were always on hand to help, really friendly as were the Reception team. Takeaway coffee from the cafe in the Reception area is excellent too, with a friendly barista and costs $20 Namibian dollars. The car park is secure and underground but as our car was quite big we were allowed to stay parked in the forecourt. We would definitely stay here again.","Date of stay: August 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This Hotel needs maintenance","I am regularly staying at this hotel, but it is really going backwards and it needs maintenance. For about a year now the boom at the parking does not work. Every time you want to exit, it does not work and then you need to wait for someone to open it for you. The one escalator is also not working. You need to use your room key card to allow you to go up to your floor. The key card in this escalator is not working which mean you need to wait for another escalator before you can go up to your room. The network in this hotel is more down than working. For a person on business it is not acceptable. It is just my view that the hotel is not managed that well anymore and they need new management or investment in order to get it back to standard.","Date of stay: June 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very disappointing experience","Upon checking into the hotel I was charged $1200 Namibian dollars on my credit card in case I wanted to use items from the Mini bar. There was nothing in the mini bar which I reported immediately at 3 and when I left for dinner at 8 it still had not been stocked. I did not have menus for room service, no trash container, no hairdry and each problem required several phone calls to resolve.","Date of stay: October 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The hotel is beautiful. The positive stops there.","I stayed at the Hilton for 5 days on business in August 2012. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms gorgeous, probably one of the better looking business hotels I have stayed in. Unfortunately the food and management does not live up to this standard. There is only one regular restaurant and two more that serve light food only. The regular one has mostly meat as the few choices of seafood on the menu were not available when i was there. Similarly, the choice of room service is poor and in any case the quality of  food is not what one would expect from the Hilton. I ordered the soup of the day yesterday (pepper soup) and was barely edible. The cheese plate was made up of cheap cheddar and gouda, the kind that people use to make cheap sandwiches. Besides issues with room service forgetting my room or not refilling the bathroom supplies, the worst experience was at the check-out. I asked to separate expenses into two bills and pay with two different credit cards. I simply asked for meals and laundry on one bill and all the rest together. Apparently, this was too complicated and the staff at the receptionist split the bill according to her own judgement, irrespective of what I has asked for. After over minutes, she managed to produce two different bills. After I paid, it turned out that the amount on the bills she put in the envelope didn't correspond to what was charged to my credit card. When i asked for that to be rectified, it turned out she had overcharged me and one of the supervisors came to help. Another 30 minutes passed and they could not sort out the mess in any sensible way so I had to ask to get refunded for the previous payments and start afresh by paying the full bill with just one credit card as clearly they were not able to handle splitting the bill into two. They still tried to charge me more for the airport pick up than the rate given by reservation and thoroughly discussed with staff the night before. I still can't believe something like that would happen at the Hilton. Some of the staff at the reception should definitely not be there or not entrusted with people's credit cards. Also, the hilton needs to fix its transportation issues and be able to offer a reliable taxi service to its customers. The management has a lot to do to straighten this place up. There are a gazillion staff working there and all look impeccable and are very polite but they need to learn how to actually do their job well.","Date of stay: August 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good hotel ","As a diamond member we were upgraded to a good executive room on 8th floor which had outstanding views over the city. Best feature is the rooftop bar and pool. There are plenty of sun loungers of all types and the views are outstanding. Good cocktails at the roof bar but obviously not cheap as it is probably the best located bar in town. Hotel very clean and well presented Executive lounge has a good selection of hot and cold food as well as good selection of alcoholic drinks during evening reception. We kept being told by staff that it wasn‚Äôt safe to walk outside as too many pickpockets so organised a half day city tour which was pretty good. There were 3 tour guides with 4x4 outside the hotel ready and waiting to do tours. Probably one of the better hotels in Windhoek","Date of stay: February 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Generally good stay","I stayed at the Hilton for 3 nights and my experience was generally good.The facilities are really great and easily accessible. The rooftop bar is tops. They have a nice drinks and tapas menu and the sunset views are amazing!!!The hotel is well located with a craft market and shopping centre within 5min walking distance.If you're travelling for work, the hotel is also great as most of the financial services businesses are located within walking distance.The staff were friendly across the board, from check in to the shuttle service to the restaurant.Both room service and the restaurant served some good food, with the daily buffet menu also with a good variety.The only point of improvement I'd note is the WiFi. The connectivity was very patchy.","Date of stay: September 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sch√∂nes Stadthotel in idealer Lage","Allgemein:Bedingt durch ein Mi√üverst√§ndnis unseres Veranstalters war unsere Buchung im urspr√ºnglich gebuchten Hotel nicht verf√ºgbar. Wir wurden aber schnell und unb√ºrokratisch ins Hilton umgebucht.Lage und Umgebung:Das Hotel liegt im Stadtzentrum von Windhoek ca. 45 km entfernt vom internationalen Flughafen. Die Zentrale Lage erm√∂glicht es einige Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten, wie die Christuskirche, Alte Feste mit Reiterstatue oder auch das Unabh√§ngigkeitsmuseum fu√ül√§ufig zu erreichen.Zimmer:Das Hotel verf√ºgt √ºber 150 Zimmer. Wir bewohnten eines im 4. Stock. Gleich am Eingang im Flur befindet sich der frei programmierbare Safe, im Anschlu√ü daran die R√ºckwand des Badezimmerspiegels der als Raumteiler fungiert, dann der Kleiderschrank. Zus√§tzlich gibt es einen gro√üen Schreib-Ablagetisch, mit Fernseher, Minibar, Schubladen und gen√ºgend Stromanschl√ºssen. Der Haartrockner ist in einer der Schubladen fest installiert. Das gro√üe Doppelbett war sehr hoch, aber bequem. Im Badezimmer gab es eine Dusche, eine Badewanne und ein Waschbecken. Die Toilette hatte nochmals eine separate Abtrennung. Ansonsten war das Bad zum Schlafraum hin offen.Service:Check-in und out waren schnell erledigt. V√∂llig unb√ºrokratisch wurde der Voucher unseres urspr√ºnglich gebuchten Hotels akzeptiert. Die Koffer wurden schnell zu unserem Zimmer gebracht. Bereits um 10 Uhr vormittags konnten wir unser Zimmer beziehen. Die Reinigung nach Check-out des vorherigen Gastes h√§tte etwas gr√ºndlicher sein d√ºrfen, wir fanden auf dem Stuhl eine abgebrochene Rasierklinge. Das sollte nat√ºrlich nicht passieren.Gastronomie:Wir hatten √úF gebucht und konnten am Abreisetag das Fr√ºhst√ºck in Buffetform genie√üen. Hier fehlte es an nichts. Br√∂tchen, Brot, Wurstvariationen (hier merkt man die deutsche Vergangenheit), K√§se, Salat, Joghurt, M√ºsli, Obst, warme Speisen, Station f√ºr Eier oder Waffeln. Sehr gut sortiert und schmackhaft.Am Tag unserer Anreise entschieden wir uns abends im Hotel zu essen. Hier wurden wir sehr nett bedient. Das Essen war geschmacklich sehr gut und wie bestellt. Und das alles zu einem sehr fairen Preis.Abends besuchten wir noch die Sky-Bar auf dem Dach. Diese ist auf jeden Fall sehenswert. Wenn man auf die Dachterasse kommt ist dort zuerst der Pool, dann etliche Nischen, in die man sitzen kann. Die Bar ist im Freien und man hat einen sehr sch√∂nen Blick auf das n√§chtliche Windhoek.","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Delivers on the Hilton name","Very centrally located and comfortable though I prefer bathrooms with doors instead of the open style that they have in the rooms. The rainfall shower made my mornings and the wine list, my evenings. The bed was firm and comfortable and sound proofing is good to the extent that you can not hear all the work going on next to the hotel on the extension. Decently priced Beyerskloof Pinotage if you prefer red would be my recommendation. The hotel has quite some entertainment going on in the roof terrace or restaurant/bar and the jazz band on the Friday was great! The gym could do with some weights but quite functional for most travelers. Indian buffet on Thursdays (or was it Wednesday!) was nice and offered variety.Outside the hotel, you can walk around nearby to see probably most of what Windhoek has to offer including the church, the artisans market, the independence monument, parliament etc. It was safe to walk around as long as you do not start flashing expensive stuff.And yes, the staff were very helpful and service was great. All that you would expect from another great Hilton.","Date of stay: November 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Almost there","The Hilton Windhoek is one of the best hotels in Windhoek for both business and leisure.  However, they should really look into fine-tuning their Reception.  It has been, each time I have visited, the worst check-in I have ever experienced anywhere in the world. It is staffed with employees who don't seem to be well trained.  As a result, they are inefficient, and when the queue for service at their desk becomes longer than 2, they become overwhelmed, rude and unhelpful. Having a Front Office Manager in FRONT their team, instead of in the office at the BACK of reception, would go a long way towards creating a better professional impression.The rooms, restaurants and housekeeping, are all very good.On Fridays, the staff dress in their traditional tribal attire.  It is wondrous.","Date of stay: August 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hotel needs TLC","I spent 8 nights at the Hilton and I was very unimpressed.Firstly on arrival I was booked into a room next to the main air con unit. The continuous noise was very disruptive.I asked to be moved and was put into room 320. The first thing I noticed was the main lights didn't work and the light in one of the cupboards didn't switch off. The other thing that was fixed during the stay was the shower. After the first shower the floor in bathroom was flooded.That was the easy part when returning one evening the access boom to the basement parking broke and fell on the roof of my rental car. To add to the annoyance and inconvenience the staff at the hotel didn't handle the matter professionally at all.The food at the hotel is extremely overpriced for the quality and the cleaning service of the rooms is very substandard.Hilton please give this hotel the tlc it requires to be at the level it should be!And please check the pool it looks like it's going to fall through the roof.","Date of stay: August 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The Place to be in Windhoek","This Hilton is well situated in the CBD close to all the key places on would want to visit in Windhoek. The check-in process was a breeze, loved the 'online self check-in' process which is very easy to use and I even got an upgrade here. The rooms are super super clean, well maintained with very comfortable beds. The internet though not so bad, may need some improvement. I honestly loved this hotel. A step up above other Hiltons. A complaint though, related to the airport transfer. I request an express service so I could get to my meetings on time. However when I got to the airport, I was told I had to wait for other passengers first as we were to share a van. This wait took a good 30+ minutes and is the reason I rarely check-in baggage. Interesting thing is I was still charged for the express car service yet I didn't get to use it. The same thing happened when I left, worse still, the contracted Taxi guy stated that he was even paid less than what was on my bill. I think you guys need to clean up whatever happens there. I'm interested to help should you need it. Otherwise, a lovely stay in Namibia and can't wait to come back. This was actually my second visit after about 3 years.","Date of stay: April 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Watch out for hidden extras, doesn't feel like a Hilton","Stayed on the first floor here in January 2016.  I booked my room via the Hilton website, during their sale.The room was fine, perfectly comfortable.  Just a couple of problems, one being that I had no hot water one morning, the other being the intermittent WIFI outages.  Nothing major wrong though.On going to Breakfast on the first day I was asked my room number, and I was informed that my room didn't include breakfast. I told them it did, and they said they would change it.  The same thing happened the second day, and every day after that.  (My room rate did include breakfast and it was pretty clear on the reservation).When checking out they attempted to charge me for making a phone call.  The phone call was in fact INCOMING.  The value they were charging was low, but it was more to do with them even trying to do that.  They actually had the cheek to blame the Hilton Group for this.The food was fine as was the gym. The pool is a bit odd, being next to a rooftop bar that has aspirations to be a cool place to hang out.  It just didn't seem inviting to go for a swim.   Having said that, the bar was very good.If I were to come back to Windhoek I think I would avoid paying the premium to stay at the Hilton.  It really wasn't any better than a number of the other hotels / lodges that my colleagues were at- and they cost around half the price.","Date of stay: January 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good hardware, pity about the service","This hotel is the newest and most impressive building in the city. That's where it ends. Our check in experience was horrid from the start.No bellboy to help us lug our luggage from the taxi. The receptionist was a little haughty. She told us the hotel was fully booked and we did not have the twin rooms which I clearly indicated when I booked. Also my HHonors card number was not communicated properly.She ""informed"" me that our rate did not include breakfast and I had to fish out the booking voucher from my email - making us feel like untrustworthy people instead of regular business travelers which we are.We were led to the rooms in a most unprofessional manner. The bellboy cramped into the already small lifts with the luggage trolley. In most sensible hotels, the luggage comes separately so guests can be comfortable in the lifts. We called the duty manager about the mess up and suddenly a twin room suddenly became available!The kind gentleman who helped us move room was a gem but by then the damage had been done.In the new room, the shower drainage was clogged. Complimentary water non-existent.My colleague and I checked out and swore never to return. We stay in African hotels a lot and this is a very bad experience for a supposedly five star hotel.","Date of stay: August 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Average city hotel","This is your average city hotel with average service. I walked into the non-smoking room and my friend and I could immediately smell something bad in the room. Reception indicated that the room had been a smoking room until June 2014, which explained the smell. I would have expected a conversion like this to have been done better, particularly to smell like that 7 months later. The bathrooms are completely open, so no provacy, which made staying with a friend rather awkward. Wifi is free in the communal areas but you need to pay for wifi if you want it in you room - which seems rather 'cheap' of a Hilton hotel! I had to try 8 of the communal wifi codes before one worked. The pool area is next to a bar on the 9th floor. The pool was so full when we arrived and it didn't look like anyone was checking who was actually staying at the hotel and who wasn't - so felt like a bit of a 'free for all'. The breakfast was realy good!!","Date of stay: January 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton Hotel","I was terribly disappointed in this hotel. I had a problem with hot water in my room and getting it sorted out was a mission. Service at the Sky Bar was extremely poor and in the end I didn't eat or drink anything since no one even offered to take my order. I forgot a jacket at the hotel and went back there to ask whether house keeping handed it in. I had to wait 45 minutes for them to go and have a look in lost and found. The jacket was not there. I also didn't have a good nights rest since it was very noisy in the hallways. I will not recommend this hotel since I think there are better options.","Date of stay: December 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sorry, but much better available in Windhoek at a third of the price.","I stayed at this hotel in July and found the service to be very poor. The rooms are really nice and well laid out, but the staff were arrogant and lazy. A very bad experience at the Sky Bar with service and quality of the meal. It was served cold, and took 90 minutes. Breakfast was not up to Hilton normal standard. Pretty much the same as a normal 3 to 4 star. Many people that have been here have complained about similar issues. When a complaint to management was sent it was not dealt with ver well.","Date of stay: July 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A greatly desgined hotel, but as far as could be from 5 star service!","The Hilton in Windhoek is probably the most modernly designed hotel in Windhoek, very comfortable and convenient rooms opened almost a year ago. Breakfast is more than average, but's that's all what's positive about it. Even though I frequently stay there ( and currently staying there) I still get inadequate service every time I stay there. My room does not always get properly cleaned, one time the cleaning person even forgot some of his/her cleaning equipment in the room. Internet is slow, the Wireless flaps evey minute, housekeeping take a lot to reply, the new TV magazine which has the monthly programs never came even though we were 2 days in the new month,  room service is frequently out of the dishes I want, and the menu is very poor as well, the business lounge was rented out when I asked to use it , I was told to use the executive lounge on the top floor for which you have to wait for at least 10 - 15 minutes for someone to let you in (since those who work there seem frequently away) Clearly there seems to be a huge managerial problem. When I checked in the lady who checked me in told me breakfast and internet were included in my rate, a couple of days later, the waitress in the restaurant embarrassed me and literally told me in public that I have not been signing my breakfast bill ever since I came and that I need to see reception for that! When I went to reception the lady who checked me in was there and she actually denied ever telling me that the breakfast was included in my rate! Her manager told me that the misunderstanding was that the fact that rate was BB was written as a side note and they have not updated the restaurant system. I have waited for an official apology from the management, that unfortunately never came. If anyone from the global Hilton management is reading this I'd like to say that I do not appreciate the lack of integrity of some of the staff , nor the lack of professionalism of the management. I really hope you do something about it. This is by no means Hilton Standards!!","Date of stay: December 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"An evening in Hilton Hotel","An evening in Hilton Hotel Elvis Mboya On 6 August 2011 was not my first time to sample services on offer at Hilton Windhoek. I had been there before to attend a pre-opening media brief, the official opening ceremony and a corporate function hosted by Windhoek Observer.  As an entertainment and lifestyles writer with nearly a decade of experience in the country and southern Africa, I have witnessed the rise and fall of taverns, but, Hilton‚Äôs superior services, facilities and gentle and seductive atmosphere, are poised to thrust this first five-star facility in the country to greater heights. The 10-storey landmark facility that was officially opened by President Hifikepunye Pohamba in June,  is the completed N$300 million project that forms part of the N$2 billion Eliakim Namundjebo Plaza owned by United Africa Group (UAG), a pet project of Martha Namundjebo-Tilahun and Addis Tilahun. The launch was graced by the who is who of the country‚Äôs politics, economic and social spectrum. The scorecardSince its doors opened to the public, the facility instantly became the place to be for socialites thirsty for entertainment as well as offering conference and meeting hub for businesspeople yearning for five-star service and soothing environment.  In recent times, eager guests have been flocking in their hundreds to the spectacular landmark nestled in the heart of the city, barely 20 a-minutes‚Äô drive from Hosea Kutako International Airport. Since then, there have been flurry of debate on social utility networks, and on the streets, with revellers worried about the prices at the hotel. However, they soon realised that the facility‚Äôs uncompromised hospitality standards come at a relatively affordable price compared to most of its peers in hospitality and tourism industry that have a 4- and 3-star rating. Value for moneyFor instance, a Windhoek Lager beer costs N$18 at Hilton compared to several sprouting restaurants and lounges in the city that charge the same for the bottle or more. A decent meal costs about N150 and cheapest accommodation N$1,400 per night. That does not mean the quality of the service is compromised. The management understands that there are different groups of economic classes that can afford to mingle with the high and mighty, with a beer that costs N$18 in the same facility. The upper class client are catered for with drinks like the Johnny Walker blue label that costs N$200 a tot.  Still, exclusivity, class, and superior facilities are uncompromised for those who can afford it. Guests with deeper pockets can be ushered into the superior comfort of presidential, diplomatic suites in exclusive lounges for those who want value for their money.   Dining at Hilton Windhoek is an experience worth trying out. There are restaurants of choice that include Ekipa, Kalabar, Terrace, Centrum Lounge, Divine Wine Bar and Sky Bar.  Superior facilities The Sky Bar is located on the roof top of the building next to a swimming pool. The spot offers a spectacular view of the city‚Äôs central business district. The facility offers varied leisure activities that include a 24-hour wellness and fitness centre (gym and massage room), heated lap pool complete with sundeck located at the roof top.  Business travellers, tourists and local corporate executives have varied choices of conference rooms with a capacity of accommodating 250 guests. The facility also offers a convenient tuck shop, an ATM, internet facilities, laundry, and exclusive executive floor lounge. Luxurious accommodation includes one presidential suite, 124 king rooms (including eight king deluxe, four executive guest rooms), 22 executive rooms, 12 double rooms.  Pride of the nationThe facility forms the first phase of Windhoek‚Äôs new N$2 billion Freedom Plaza complex. The  building integrates retail, offices, residential and entertainment with the hotel. This is the first five-star hotel, and one of the largest developments of this nature in Namibian hospitality industry and is set to transform the urban face and dynamics of the Windhoek CBD.Namibia becomes the 50th in the world, and seventh country in Africa to have the prestige of Hilton branded hotel, joining South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, Cameroon, Nigeria and Tanzania.A day or evening at Hilton Windhoek is an experience to remember.The author is a Kenyan born Namibian investigative journalist working in Southern Africa since 2002.

"Leider entsprach diese Hotel nicht den Standard eines Hilton Hotels!","Das Hilton in Windhoek hat leider keinen guten Eindruck hinterlassen. Der Check-in dauerte sehr lange, obwohl nichts los war. Die St√ºhle im Restaurant waren durchgesessen und sehr unbequem. Der L√§rm in der offenen K√ºche war sehr laut. Nichtsdestotrotz stank meine Kleidung anschlie√üend so stark nach K√ºche, dass ich sie nicht mehr tragen konnte. Das bestellte take-away Fr√ºhst√ºck enthielt alles das was ich nicht bestellt hatte.Eine gro√üe Entt√§uschung.","Date of stay: June 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Leider nicht mehr so gut wie fr√ºher","Wir haben unsere Namibiarundreise bereits zum dritten Mal im Hilton Hotel Windhoek ausklingen lassen (2018/2019/2023). Wir hatten uns schon sehr auf den Aufenthalt gefreut, da wir die Jahre davor immer sehr zufrieden waren. Leider wurden wir entt√§uscht. Aus welchen Gr√ºnden auch immer hat vor allem der Service sehr nachgelassen (die MA scheinen sich nicht richtig auszukennen, m√ºssen st√§ndig bei Kolleg:innen nachfragen, sehr langsamer Service). Leider ist auch die Qualit√§t des Essens nicht mehr dieselbe (keine Avocados im Avocadosalat, abgespecktes Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet, ""wir haben dies nicht, wir haben das nicht mehr""). Auch die Einrichtung im Zimmer war teilweise kaputt. Leider wurden wir diesmal entt√§uscht und hoffen, dass das Hotel an den M√§ngeln arbeitet und zuk√ºnftig wieder die gewohnte Qualit√§t bieten kann.","Date of stay: January 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Worst Customer Service EVER","The rooms are fine - typical hotel chain quality.  The bathrooms are a bit more upscale with separate shower stall, bathtub and separate toilet.  However the bathroom is open to the room so no privacy for bath or shower.  The reason I rated this hotel a 2 - and that was generous - was largely based on the incompetence and lack of customer service we experienced during both of our stays.  We bookended our 3 week trip of Namibia with a stay at this hotel.  Our first stay we had electrical fan noises in our room - so loud as to be disturbing.  We reported it and were told someone would fix it.  We went out for dinner and upon our return our room was open - unlocked - with all of our belongings available to anyone who wished to help themselves!!!  We notified and voiced our displeasure to the Management who apologized and promised to upgrade us to an executive room with lounge access for our return stay.  The return stay - checked into our ‚Äòexecutive‚Äô room which was no different than the original room. We did have lounge access and the food and amenities in the lounge were quite good.  In preparation for our departure to the airport we prebooked and prepaid for airport transfer through the hotel the day before for a 10am pickup.  The next morning we went to check out and:a) we were charged for the upgraded room which was supposed to be a complimentary upgrade.  This problem was sorted after some time.  B) our 10am transfer did not appear.  No one seemed to know what was going on and no one seemed to be able to secure us an alternative transport.  We kept getting told - just 10 minutes - then another 10 - then another. The staff and Management seemed to have the competence of Guinea fowl. Finally I insisted on a refund of our money and once refunded the Manager was ready to leave us to our own devices.  This is NOT customer service.  If you mess up and leave customers in the lurch Management needs to fix the issue. As a customer it shouldn‚Äôt be up to me to get Hilton to take responsibility for their ineptitude and get us transport and pick up the tab for the transfer.  In the end, we did get transport - 40min late - and hopefully Hilton will pay the driver. Suggest to stay elsewhere in Windhoek.  Avani Hotel looked like a reasonable alternative.","Date of stay: June 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hate the room design","Staff are friendly and helpful, buffet breakfast pretty good. However, I hate the room design - I've never seen the need for the bathroom to be part of the bedroom and it's useless if you‚Äôre not both getting up at the same time. Also no hairdryer, which is annoying if you have long hair. Won't be staying again despite the staff.","Date of stay: October 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Located at great location and excellent services from the staffs","I stayed at Hilton for longer days and the hotel is located at middle of the city and very convenient for shopping and restaurant experience around the hotel. The room is spacious and clean. The required amenities are available including TV, WiFi, safe, fridge, daily drinking bottle water, iron etc. the bed is comfortable. All staffs at front desk, housekeeping and restaurant provide excellent services. Breakfast is included and it is buffet. If you stay longer, the breakfast is mostly the same and I suggest to the management variety changes daily. Fresh fruits are provided and it is refreshing. Room service orders are available and $5 is added on the order. For me, $5 added on room services is a lot and could discourage room service orders. In general, Hilton is one of the best hotel in Windhoek.","Date of stay: September 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There‚Äôs a point in the afternoon when the hotel restaurants are closed and the place in the lobby does not offer much variety. If you need food you can order room service. Internet has the problem that you need to connect often even if you‚Äôre registered to stay for a long time.

"Great hotel in Windhoek ","Our family stayed here one night before the start of a 7 day Safari through Namibia and then one night on the way back. The first stay we had regular rooms and they way back the executive suite. This property looks very new. Nicely decorated. We had an issue our second stay with a leak in the executive suite and staff immediately moved us into Presidential suite which was 5 star all the way. The hotel restaurant breakfast is an amazing spread. Complete with gluten free options and a juice bar. Worth getting it added to your room rate. Top floor has a nice outdoor sky bar with great views of the city, along with a small pool and sun deck. Small but adequate fitness center an d spa. Executive lounge was nice with computer and printers. Hotel is walking distance to shopping , museum and drug store. The staff is incredibly accommodating and friendly.

"Very nice and impressive hotel in the middle of the city","We stayed here for 1 night upon arrival into Windhoek.  The hotel was very new and modern.  I am a Hilton Gold member and we had access to the lounge and it didn't disappoint.  Self service appetizers and drinks.  (Alcoholic and non-alcoholic) They had a nice variety and even smoked salmon in the mornings.  The pool is on the rooftop along with a bar, and while we didn't get a chance to use it, it looked very nice.  Great modern American style gym.  Cardio machines, free weights, all the works and big space.  Breakfast in the morning was phenomenal.  One of the best I have ever had.  Tons of options something for everybody.  Too much good stuff to list.  It was free for gold and platinum members.  I think it was pretty expensive otherwise maybe around $25 USD.  The rooms were very modern and spacious.  Service was excellent.  It was like being in a nice Hilton in America, but in Namibia.  And after the month we spent in Africa it was a nice taste of home.  The location was right in the middle of the city.  About a 10-15 walk to the mall and right next to the street markets.  Would 100% recommend.  I think it cost about 30,000 Hilton points or around $140-150 USD each night.

"Very nice hotel perfectly located","The rooms are very nicely decorated, super clean, everything works perfectly, great beds and perfect showers.Very good breakfast, although a bit noisy if you are close to the kitchen (they have to fix the kitchen extractor, which is noisy and does not seem to extract the odors from the pancakes and eggs).Service is very good and the location of the hotel cannot be better.","Date of stay: November 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Best Hilton I have stayed in","My room was very large and comfortable, and the breakfasts were excellent, offering everything you could possibly want. There is a long, thin swimming pool on the top floor and next to it a bar which is great for watching the sunset. There is parking under the hotel which is useful. It is only a short walk to the Christuskirche, town and markets.The only slight negative is if you like a really dark bedroom this isn't for you as the open plan bathroom adjoining the bedroom  lets light through.The staff were all very pleasant, and I found the Italian Buffet very good despite a previous reviewer saying avoid it.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Perfect place to start or end a safari","After a week camping on safari, this hotel was bliss! It's a perfect place to spend a night or two. I've stayed in numerous Hilton's all over the world and this is definitely one of the nicer ones. The room was lovely, the staff were friendly, the pool was clean and the breakfast was good. We tried a more local hotel before the safari, thinking we should avoid the big chain hotels but we regretted it.

Their motto seemed to be ""Arrogance is Trump"".

"Nice modern hotel in sleepy Windhoek","We were in Windhoek during a national holiday, the city was all but abandoned.Due to the fact we arrived early and our booked room was not ready we were upgraded to a very nice room with a big terrace.Due to the national holiday there were practically no restaurants open so we took both lunch and dinner in the Hilton hotel. Quality of the food and service is good.We also had cocktails at the rooftop bar which offers a nice view over Windhoek. The location of the hotel is ideal and there was ample parking space for our rental car in the underground parking lot.","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A friendly home away from home","The hotel is very typical Hilton with its prime location in the middle of the city. Despite its fairly commercial appearance it has a sense of gaiety which made the experience of staying there fun.There is no doubt that the architects were out to make the hotel a landmark rather than another people store.The lobby is generous and the atrium connects the different public areas well. The Skybar is a real success and became the place we met each evening for a sundowner. Sunsets in Namibia are not to be missed!The room was well laid out with the bathroom flowing into the bedroom. The desk could have been better and it would have been good to be able to look a the view whilst working.Comfortable beds are a feature of Hiltons and this one is no exception.The food was very good. We had to eat several meals in the hotel and we're pleased with all of them. Obviously the choice of venison was a major plus.The staff were efficient and friendly. I was left with the impression of a ship well run.","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Aufenthalt in Windhoek","Wir sch√§tzen es, jeweils am letzten Tag unserer Reise nach Namibia, im Hilton Hotel direkt im Zentrum von Windhoek zu √ºbernachten. Sehr angenehm ist, dass man in den Abendstunden entweder in der Skybar (9. Stock) den Sonnenuntergang geniessen kann oder nach dem Abendessen noch bei einem Drink in der Bar (4. Stock) den Tag ausklingen lassen kann. Die Internetverbindung ist sehr gut, allerdings muss man das teuer bezahlen.

"Great Time in Hilton","The hotel is located in the center and has all the facilities you will need. I liked the room which was cozy and well equipped, service was excellent and friendly. Breakfast was good although it could be varied from a day to day (stayed there for 6 nights). The only disadvantage I had was a horrible WiFi connection which was disconnecting all the time, and when it was on it had a poor speed connection which was vital for my work and activities. Except from that all was good and I would certainly come back (please improve breakfast and internet connection!).","Date of stay: December 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Abends gibt es einen turn-down-Service.Lounge: Die Lounge befindet sich im obersten Stockwerk gegen√ºber der Skybar. Sie ist zweist√∂ckig und man hat einen sch√∂nen Ausblick. Snacks werden nachmittags/abends serviert, morgens gibt es dort eine kleine Fr√ºhst√ºcksauswahl (kein volles Buffet, aber es ist f√ºr jeden etwas dabei).Vom obersten Stockwerk (hier befindet sich auch die Bar und der Pool) hat man einen tollen Blick auf die Stadt. Das Hotel ist insgesamt sehr sch√∂n gestaltet und modern eingerichtet.Lage: In Gehweite von Christuskirche, Tintenpalast und Museum.

"Sehr gutes Hotel mitten in Windhoek","Das Hilton ist ein modernes Hotel mitten in Windhoek. Alle Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten k√∂nnen zu Fu√ü erreicht werden. Parken in der Tiefgarage ca. 6 Euro pro Nacht. Zimmer ausreichend gro√ü und sehr modern eingerichtet. Das Bad ist offen, d.h. der Sp√ºlstein ist im Zimmer und Dusche und WC nur durch eine Milchglasscheibe vom Zimmer getrennt. Gro√üe Fensterfront, angenehme individuelle Klimatisierung. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war sehr reichhaltig und abwechslungsreich. Auch Abendessen im Hotel hat uns sehr gut gefallen. Man kann w√§hlen zwischen a la carte oder einem t√§glich wechselnden Themenb√ºffet (an einem Abend gab es lokale afrikanische Spezialit√§ten). Auch Pool, Dachbar und das Fitnessstuidio mit toller Aussicht haben uns gut gefallen. Einziger Minuspunkt und deswegen nur 4 Punkte: An unserem ersten Tag waren Pool, Bar und Fitnessbereich f√ºr die ""normalen"" G√§ste gesperrt, da dort eine private Party war. Dies reduziert unserer Meinung nach die Hotelg√§ste zu Kunden zweiter Klasse. Und schlie√ülich hat man ja auch als ""normaler"" Hotelgast bei der Buchung Bar, Fitnesstudio und Pool zugesagt bekommen bzw. daf√ºr bezahlt. Eine Preiserm√§√üigung gab es n√§mlich nicht. Aber ansonsten wirklich ein empfehlenswertes Hotel.","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Affordable Luxury in Africa","The Hilton in Windhoek comes loaded with all the comforts, luxury elements and benifits you would expect from a Hilton chain outpost in Africa(like the ones in Equatorial Guinea, South Africa etc.) But the nice part is this one comes at a much cheaper price than its cousins in other African locations , which makes it a great bang-for-the-buck property to treat yourself to some luxury in Africa without boring a hole into your wallet! The Rooftop SKYBAR is a uber chic place to lounge and gets crowded with fancy folks and who's-who of the town. The sports bar and the other restaurants on the first floor are top rated establishments too. The BREAKFAST is a huge highlight too and comes with a Mindblowing spread, fine gourmet baked items, Local and international choices, fantastic hot and cold food, refreshing juices & smoothies, barista made hot beverages & espressos.. the list goes on. Absolute steal if your package includes Breakfast!!LOCATION: Great location and not too far from key points of interest or top rated eating and drinking establishments(if you have a car or a taxi at your disposal)THE ROOM: Since i am a HHonors DIAMOND member, i was upgraded to the EXECUTIVE SUITE room -So this is based off that. AIR CONDITIONING:Very controlled but after tinkering with the Power controls could get the stuff going in the Living room at least; SIZE: HUMOUNGOUS! The suite came with a Huge living room , dining area and a massive Bed room ; AMENTITIES: Wonderful toileteries(PETER ROTH Branded); BED - Lovely bed for a good night's sleep; BATHROOM -HUGE and stylish bathroom with a good stand-in showerFITNESS FACILITIES: Decent Fitness center that comes with all the key Cardio machines. Weights are limited to Dumbells that dont go beyond 10KG. However there is one workout station that you can train with(see photos). And the best part is the gym comes with spectacular views of the city since it is located on the Rooftop! Lovely pool which cannot be used during cold and normal days as it is outdoor on the rooftop and it gets chilly and windy on most days.SERVICE : Friendly service and very polite staffHOW WIRED YOU WOULD BE: FREE Wifi that worked all around the property, but not the fastest connections you would expect from a Luxury chain hotel. Good choice of TV channels - both English and international covering Music, movies, sports and other entertainment","Date of stay: August 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Odd rooms","The Hilton is located in the CBD of Windhoek surrounded by government offices.  We were staying on a HH Points stay & the staff were welcoming & efficient.  We broke the coffee machine in the lounge but the attendant was happy to get us some elsewhere.  The room was business modern decor with a small, private rooftop garden. Very nice.  But I would be amiss if I didn't mention the room layout.  It is hard to describe but there is no privacy in the main part of the bathroom.  The shower is enclosed & the toilet has a closet but these open up into the no-privacy zone.  So as other reviewers have noted, you had better really like your roommate.","Date of stay: May 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Certo, gli orari del ristorante sono un po' sacrificati, a volte rientrando tardi non resta che un pasto in camera buono ma non eccelso.

"Fantastic","We only had one night here at this lovely hotel but it was great!  Our room was a suite so it was all you could wish for and more.  Located on the 8th floor, we had a large living room plus spacious bedroom, two delightful bathrooms - one with a bath.   Everything was absolutely amazing and so much more than we ever needed but being totally spoiled for one night was wonderful!We ate at the coffee shop there and the food was very nice.  It is very convenient to be able to walk out the back of the hotel as a shortcut to the shops and market which we spent some time looking around the afternoon we arrived.  Great place to stay.Staff were friendly and helpful ensuring we were looked after.","Date of stay: July 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Small details matter the most","I am getting ready to check out of the Hilton in Windhoek. Its a fantastic hotel on the surface. Great looking building, fantastic modern rooms and a great location with a lovely pool deck and bar on the 9th floor.I was however really aggravated by a few small, but important things for me.1. The bedroom walls seem thin. One can hear many sounds in the room next door, so if your neighbor is an early riser - or a noisy one, you will hear it all, from the opening of medicine containers to the flushing of the loo.2. Room service is slow. Not the kitchen, but the delivery to the room. When you order, expect it to arrive cold.3. In a modern world, and hotel charging R3000 ($270) per night should not be charging their guest for internet access. And this Internet access is a disgrace!.  The only part that works well is the billing system.  After that, the connection is slow and intermittent.  I really hope the Hilton people are ashamed of this, and maybe they will address it. If its junk - don't charge for it.4. The design of  the property results in there being an atrium from the 1st floor to the 8th. If there is noisy on floor 2, it affects all floors - and the resultant sleep quality.Rooms  x13 and x14 are slightly immune to this due to their location - try and book these.Not sure I will return.","Date of stay: March 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The food was good in the Restaurant, the staff were very helpful, everyone had a smile and the place was clean.   the rooms are large and well equipped.   We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this hotel and would definitely stay there again.

"Resting on its five-star laurels","The Windhoek Hilton is the only five-star show in town (apart from one or two boutique options) and they rest on these laurels. The hotel has all the right amenities, but absolutely no charm. Its fine for a night or two (or a quick business trip) but if you are in town for longer,  I would make a concerted effort to find something else. This is a cookie cutter hotel chain experience with a hefty price tag. Sometimes, great staff can lift an average hotel experience to another level, but even here the Hilton does not really manage to make an impression. The overall impression is that everyone is simply going through the motions. I find it quite depressing to stay here for longer than a night or two.","Date of stay: February 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"five star????","stayed here for three nights in total.  well let me start with the 5 star story ok beautiful building entrance stunning bedrooms lovely etc but sorry that is were it ends!  i can say that the staff at this hotel need some training in certain areas!  we arrived and were starving so we ordered room service.  first of all charged 50 dollars for bringing the tray to our room.  ordered a sandwich which i could not eat it was disgusting !!  forest ham pannini well the ham was so hard we could not eat it looked as if it had been left out in the sun for a few day!  they thought it was a good idea to first cover the plate with balsamic glaze which is very sticky and then put the bread on top why i do not know !!!  they have the smallest pool i have ever seen for such a huge pool.  pool is on the top floor next to the sky bar well that is another story.  they have 8 loungers which i can tell you now you would need to get up there at 6 am to get one!  the bar is open to the public so you have every tom dick and harry passing you by so if you want  a relaxing day by the pool this is not for you rather stay in your room!  bar staff at this bar are very disorganised and took them half a hour to do a cocktail which i then told them not to bother as my daughter had already gone back to her room.i just got the impression that staff we're very disorganised which is a pity as it has potential to be a good hotel but for me i won't be back.","Date of stay: December 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Rooms were tastefully furnished and modern with huge bathrooms. The rooftop pool was great, morning swims were the order of the day. Rooftop bar great for after work drinks. Breakfast was exceptional with a huge variety. Smoothies made to order a great touch and local 'date muffins' a treat. Chef came to table and engaged with guests. Service generally was great and definitely 5*. Free wifi in general areas and not in room is not ideal in today's environment.

"Best option in Windhoek","We stayed here one evening en route to Etosha. We chose the Hilton as it was an international brand, meaning we could at least guess the experience. This also makes it one of the better hotels in Windhoek.Sadly, some of the challenges associated with staying in Africa become clear. The staff are not always well trained, and service is sometimes lacklustre. but overall, it's okay.In the afternoon, a glorious sunny day, we went to the pool bar upstairs. Loud music, a strange slice of the local set, and underwhelming service, sadly.  As an example, my wife ordered a Bloody Mary cocktail, and it was transparent green when it arrived: 40 minutes later.On the plus side, the sushi bar is a wonderful experience. Some of the freshest, best presented sushi I've seen, even when compared to Cape Town. They have a good South African wine selection which is good.Dinner in the restaurant is fairly agreeable. Certainly go for the a la carte, rather than the buffet.This hotel is good as a stop over, certainly not a destination...","Date of stay: October 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great with Poor Details","Great location, combined with a complete offer of services and amenities. Awesome rooms, quiet and clean. Amazing skybar. All these combined with very poor details. After driving around Botswana and Namibia we had free WIFI Internet access in every single campsite. We payed here 10 times the average cost of those campsites and still need to pay extra N$75 for 1h Internet access. It is not about the amount, it is the fact of having to pay for it at a city center 5 star hotel. Next day we woke up and no hot watter was running at all. We called the desk and told us that someone would show up. After 1 hour, someone came along to verify the problem. After calling the desk again, we were told that the problem would be fixed soon. At 9.30am we had to shower with cold water and speed-up to take a flight. At the check out, very light apologies were given and made us a bill discount of N$100, 4 Windhoek Lager beers. In such situation, I would have expected another reaction for such a high-class hotel.","Date of stay: August 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"5 Stars requires a review","Unfortunately does not do 5 Star rating justice. Room was fine however service needs jacking up! Took 90 mins to get a document scanned, card machine was not working in the restaurant during peak dinner period,  and the bar lady on the sky deck enjoyed sucking on the swizzle stick after stirring cocktails! Spa only had one person on duty resulting in only one of us being able to use the service.  Food was ordinary although I must admit that breakfast was really good.  I don't stay at the Hilton  regularly but I think when compared  to others I have been to in Mahe & Sydney, I think one could do better in Windhoek or alternatively rather just opt for a cheaper hotel that offers greater value.","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The rooms are attractive, and the beds are very comfortable. The bath mats do not fit under the shower doors, but that is a minor glitch, easily fixed.More importantly the staff are very friendly and helpful. One of the reception staff even kindly agreed to make a short notice booking at a local restaurant and book a taxi for us. One niggle, which has been raised by others, is the lack of free wi-fi.","Date of stay: March 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Pretty cool","The modern-style rooms are comfortable.  I liked the hard bed and deep bath tub. The staff are friendly and helpful.  Its in a good location which gives you great access to sights and shopping in Windhoek.  There is a great sky-bar on the 9th floor with a swimming pool. The view of the city is stunning from here. Well worth a visit just for that.  Great place for sundowners. You get to meet the local middle class lot, black and white.  The restaurants are good too, offering a variety of food to satisfy all sorts of palates.  Ask for  a room on as high a floor as they have. Make sure to visit Katatula township when in Whk. Day visits are safe.

"The Hilton brand, in a place one might not expect.","I stayed a total of 5 nights on 3 separate occasions, during a 3-week visit to Namibia in Dec., 2013. My company does a fair bit of business w. Hilton in the U.S. and Canada, so I'm a Hilton Honors member. I stayed at the Hilton Windhoek using a combination points and payment.From my perspective, the Hilton Windhoek proved to be a solid, comfortable base from which to explore the country in 3 different directions. It was nice, for example, after spending several nights at the Sesrium campsite on the edge of the Namib Desert, at a campsite w/out water for the better part of 2 days (a water pump broke prior to New Year's Eve, shutting off water to the entire campsite) to have a hot shower and be able to wash the grit out.The Hilton Windhoek caters to a mix of tourists, many from Europe or S.Africa, and Namibian and other businesspersons from across Africa. It's clean, pleasant, modern-looking with a really stylish interior and exterior design, and well-maintained. It's Africa ‚Äî to expect the standards of the Beverly Hilton (which I'm familiar with) is somewhat misguided.The positives: The rooms are well-designed, with a large double bed, African and European power plugs (a nice touch: those Namibian and South African 3-prong plugs are ludicrous, and even a lot of ""all-country"" power adaptors, with plugs for about 7 different continents, don't accommodate  the bizarre S.African plug). I stayed in 3 different rooms; all were pleasant, comfortable and clean.I mainlined coffee in the Centrum bar ‚Äî the only decent cup of coffee, for my taste, I found anywhere in Namibia. Some of the coffee, especially on safari, was so awful I was reduced to drinking tea, because at least pre-fab tea bags can be depended on. The Centrum coffee is quite good: It takes a while, but they brew the cup while you wait. I ordered a hamburger with a friend (she ordered chicken wrap) and, surprise, it was really quite good,much better than you would expect from a lobby-level coffee shop. The Centrum has indoor and outdoor seating on plush chairs, couches and proper tables.Check-in ‚Äî I don't normally name names, but I will here: Emmarendia ‚Äî could not have been more warm and welcoming. Dealing with employees is the luck of the draw; when you come across someone as forthright and helpful as Emmarendia, you know they won't be fronting a reception desk for long: They're management material, and it'll only be a matter of time before they move up. The next person may not be so on the ball.I've gone into detail because some of the reviews on this site ‚Äî perfectly valid, I imagine ‚Äî have complained about the service. I can only speak for myself and my own visit, but I found the service to be impeccable. As I visited on 3 separate occasions, that must count for something.An example: My first night, my shower flooded (a combination of a design flaw and a blocked drain). Hotel maintenance repaired the drain less than an hour after I reported it (trust me, you wouldn't get that kind of service in California, and I know) and housekeeping seemed brisk and efficient,. Some staff are friendlier than others, but Emmarendia and a couple of the converges I dealt with were above & beyond the call.To sum: I couldn't have asked for more. I was looking for a clean, comfortable ""base"" from which to rest and freshen up after some gnarly excursions into the back country, and that's exactly what I got. I won't hesitate to stay here on future layovers  in Windhoek.The hotel itself is centrally located, by the way, across the street from a grocery store and chicken takeout, down the street from the Kalahari Sands mall and about a 3-block walk away from a 24-hour KFC (useful when it's a holiday or Saturday, and everything else is closed). The KFC seems especially popular w. locals ‚Äî always a good sign. (North Americans note: The chicken pieces are much bigger than the ratty, expensive, over-priced portions we're used to back home: Namibian fried chicken, even KFC, puts North American fast food to shame. And it's less expensive, too.)A caveat for those who don't like street noise: I did find the street noise to be quieter on the rooms on the right side of the hotel; rooms on the left side of the hotel can be a bit noisy, especially at night, when sometimes it sounds as if some drivers are drag-racing. Didn't bother me much ‚Äî I use ear plugs, when in doubt ‚Äî but it may bother some.In all, a pleasant place to stay that I did not expect from southern Africa, at least outside South Africa. In my view, as a Hilton Honors member, certainly a credit to the Hilton name. My only fear would be if Hilton walks away one day ‚Äî it happens in the hotel business ‚Äî leaving some other chain to take over. For now, for me, it's perfect.","Date of stay: December 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sch√∂nes Hotel in Zentrumsn√§he leider mit Riesen Baustelle","Das Hotel liegt leicht zu finden an der Verl√§ngerung der Stra√üe, die vom Flughafen kommt und ist sehr leicht zu finden.  Man wir direkt an der Vorfahrt freundlich empfangen und die Koffer werden ausgeladen. Die Tiefgarage ist direkt am Haus. Bei uns gab es beim Check-in leider ziemliche Probleme. Von vier Zimmern waren 2 erst gegen 16 Uhr fertig. Wir wurden nicht telefonisch informiert, sondern haben es quasi zuf√§llig durch eine Nachfrage informiert, dass die Zimmer fertig waren. Leider war der Pool au√üer Betrieb und da laute, staubige Arbeiten durchgef√ºhrt werden, war auch das Sonnendeck nicht zu nutzen. Hinzu kommt, dass neben dem Haus eine gro√üe Baustelle ist. Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt (18.10.13) war gerade das Fundament fertig - es wird wohl noch was dauern bis das Haus fertig ist. Daher war es ab morgens fr√ºh recht laut. Die Zimmer sind sehr sch√∂n eingerichtet, die Betten hervorragend. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war auch ok.","Date of stay: October 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great addition to Windhoek's hotels","I've stayed in many of Windhoek's hotels and this is in my view the best. The architecture is spacious and attractive with a delightful reception hall and coffee bar, very spacious well equipped bedrooms, excellent restaurant and wonderful panoramic rooftop bar with pool. We spent 2 nights 14 days apart and the hotel was full, buzzing with activity. Staff were friendly. The 2nd room we had had some maintenance problems which could have been checked by housekeeping but I suspect were overlooked in a full hotel. Breakfast was as good as anything I've had in Namibia. The hotel loses a * because of the shambles mentioned by others over wifi. Not only is it unreasonably expensive(free at all the other hotels we stayed in Namibia) but mine collapsed after an hour after having to speak to the service provider and asked for 24hrs. I only paid for an hour! This was simply not good enough in a hotel claiming  5* and welcoming guests from all over the world.","Date of stay: September 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Perfect for Business Travel","I stayed at the Hilton on 2 occasions in August for business purposes, and was pleased with the service and quality of rooms. The 9th floor business lounge was a perfect semi-private meeting space with excellent food and drink to offer. The buffet breakfast and theme-night dinners in the restaurant offered exceptional choice and quality.  The downtown location of the Hilton is convenient for souvenir shopping and general daytime errands.  My only complaints are regarding the internet (hit and miss; mostly miss) and the system to exit the parking garage (we had to revisit reception twice to exit the garage successfully). A warning to be vigilant with personal belongings in the public spaces as a colleague had his phone stolen from the bar on the mezzanine level.","Date of stay: August 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not that impressive","On holiday with my family and stayed overnight in the Hilton Windhoek. I do travel a lot and is used to the best hotels in the world, this one was pretty disappointing.The Hilton is luxurious (as you would expect) with a friendly staff and good clean accommodation. This is were is ends. The heated pool was was cold (heat pump broke). We were allocated a room with an inter-leading door for the children. The children's room was not ready at the time of check-in so we initially unpacked our luggage in the 1 room. After numerous phone calls to reception (without response), eventually we were told we had to move to a different room all together. This is after we unpacked! I was not happy. We ordered Mojitos but they did not have mint leaves!We had dinner in the hotel restaurant and waited for our food for more than an hour and they got the whole order wrong!! The next morning we had breakfast in the same restaurant. On arrival the buffet area was empty with no sausages, eggs, bacon etc etc etc. I made a fuss and after 15 min this was stocked up again. I ordered a omelet, this never arrived. The whole experience was pretty disappointing and not what you expect from a Hilton hotel. I'm not convinced I will go there again.","Date of stay: June 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Outwardly impressive; inwardly needs a considerable re-think.","Although occupying a prime city centre site and with notable architecture the Hilton Windhoek is tired and needs a refresh. The main problem is its restaurant, which has limited opening hours but really (really!) bad food. Having stayed before when we didn't fancy anything from the buffet we ordered pizza plus a chicken dish from the a la carte menu. It took the metaphorical 'hours' for these simple dishes to arrive, and not without several complaints, which were treated with indifference. This time we tried the buffet for speed and it was - not to out too finer a point it - dreadful. Half cold and indifferent with bread rolls that were worse than something offered in a filling station shop. Quite how so much noise, chatter and activity in their open kitchen could produce food so bad is beyond me and is a considerable negative achievement.The irony was that a quick buffet in their casual executive facility, which we had used previously, was excellent. From the same kitchen I wonder? What was noticeable was that on a Friday night at 7 pm there were only two couples, one being us. So perhaps the restaurant has declining patronage.Also, on previous stay we found the restaurant does not serve breakfast until 7 am - hardly in keeping with international travellers' schedules.We did ask if a quick meal could be served in their rooftop pool and bar area, to which the answer was affirmative. However, as this was occupied by two blatantly obvious instances of ladies of the night entertaining their gentlemen clients by day and with rap music repeating 'I can't breath' it was not somewhere we wished to linger.The rooms are not that bad but really need a critical staff eye to spot worn out features that seem to be left to guests to discover. In one room the shower was jammed and in another the security lock did not function properly.This hotel should be highly convenient and of excellent standard but on our next visit to Namibia we will, sadly, be looking elsewhere.It's four years since we visited last and little seems to have changed in the restaurant so perhaps this review could contribute to a wake up call for the hotel's management.","Date of stay: September 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappointing stay","It was not all bad: the hotel has central location, a tasty breakfast buffet, good bathrooms - and they provided great service with an antigen test. But we arrived after a five hour car ride, only to be informed that the room was not ready as normal at 15:00. It was only made available to us at 15:45. The rooms (we had two) were underwhelming: stains on the carpet, very dirty windows (bird droppings), partially worn-down furniture, and unstable wifi. At a certain point our key cards stopped working due to a technical error, so we couldn‚Äôt use the elevator without assistance. I‚Äôve been to other Hiltons, generally with positive experiences. But for the price I paid I cannot recommend Hilton Windhoek.","Date of stay: April 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Mixed results","I stayed for 4 nights whilst on business. The hotel is one of only a few centrally located, premium hotels. Despite being modern, comfortable and well maintained, there was no internet connection available in my room throughout the stay. To compensate I was directed to use the executive lounge. Here, the staff were friendly and the internet connection worked well.  The rooftop bar and pool area is one of the hotel‚Äôs most appealing facilities. It was a lovely place to relax and enjoy the bar food and panorama of Windhoek. A major area needing improvement is the front-desk experience. I had more two separate bookings of two days each. This situation presented staff with a challenge that took a long time to resolve. A more distressing situation was the response of Benjamin the front-desk manager, to the local (female) business partners who joined us for a coffee and meeting in the lounge bar. He questioned ‚Äúwhat‚Äù we were doing, and if we ‚Äúhad permission to take photos‚Äù (of the meeting). His tone made it very clear that they were not welcome. Overall my experience at the Windhoek Hilton was mixed. Whilst I was very satisfied with the hotel facilities (other than internet), and most staff were friendly and professional, it was an inconsistent experience.","Date of stay: September 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Chaos in the lobby","This is just based on check-in so far. When we arrived we were told no rooms were ready even though it was after 3 pm. People were all over the lobby and luggage was everywhere!  There was no apology and no indication of .when rooms might be ready.  Three of our party of seven are Hilton gold or above but we were told we could not access the executive lounge sine all seven were not but we could split up and the others could stand in the lobby waiting.  We asked to see the manager and she neither apologized or offered any real help. She told us we could go up and sit by the pool in a private space. It w as however raining.  After two weeks in Namibia staying in wilderness lodges and camps this was the first bad welcome and lack of accommodation we had received--in an American hotel no less!  Which is the third world country?  I was embarrassed to be American!","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Fab hotel ","This hotel is lovely. Plush without being pretentious and very welcoming. Stunning 9th floor with a small pool, a large bar area, executive centre and well equipped gym. The rooms are lovely with beautiful bathrooms and comfy beds. Breakfast was decent with a good selection. I would definitely recommend this hotel.","Date of stay: August 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First stay","A truly stunning experience. The hotel is upmarket and located in the city centre. The rooms are very modern with excellent facilities.The WiFi is great and fast. Breakfast is excellent with an amazing variety of foods to choose from.The laundry service was very good and my clothing was laundered and delivered on the same day. The hotel has a stunning sky lounge on the 9th floor with a pool and gym. I would certainly recommend choosing the Hilton in Windhoek for both business and leisure.","Date of stay: March 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"5 Sterne im Central Business District","Hier hat eigentlich alles gepasst. Der Check-In ging schnell vonstatten, das Zimmer war gross und modern. Der Nassbereich war ebenfalls gross (sowohl separate Dusche, als auch Badewanne sind vorhanden, die Toilette ist durch eine T√ºr abgetrennt). Das Zimmer ist in Beige- und Braunt√∂nen gehalten und vermittelt dadurch ein angenehmes afrikanisches Flair. Das Hilton Windhoek befindet sich inmitten des CBD, zentraler geht es nicht mehr. Christuskirche, Alte Feste und andere Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten (Independence Museum, etc.) k√∂nnen zu Fuss in 5 Minuten erreicht werden.

"Long Weekend Windhoek","This is a good place to stay in Windhoek city center where you can enjoy the city at night and centrally located for day excursions to safaris and the such.  Exactly what I did on a 4 day weekend.  Chose this hotel as I am familiar with the Hilton experience and for the most part this hotel lives up to the brand name. No real complaints other than the showers are very slow to react to temp adjustments.","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Another great stay!","One of the best hotel in Namibia. Caring staff and well appointed rooms. Housekeeping staff Ms Nadia is always responsive to our needs. The supplies and cleanliness could not better. Our thanks to her and the team for making the stay a very pleasant one. The chief chef made our dinner in 2 occasions very special by cooking Singapore food using some chilli crab and sambal sauces. Delightful and skillful kitchen staffs prepared the food so well that both nights we felt so st home. Many thanks to them for taking on the challenge!Will definitely be back again!","Date of stay: August 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"they will give your room away and send you to a dump.","it appears to be one of the better hotels in Windhoek  but the problem is that if you are not from Namibia,  they will quite happily give your confirmed room away to a local travel agent. Windhoek was busy and when we arrived after an extremely long flight, we were told they had no room and had rebooked us (at a two star hotel). lets be clear, this was not an oversold situation. people were still checking-in even as my family (including small children) were told we could not have a room.  because these other people were locals  they got priority and our family were sent to a dump with exposed wiring, poor security  and gas cylinders in the hall. Even my Hilton status didn‚Äôt help.  Especially  frustrating was that the next day  our safari guide told us that he could have booked us into much better accommodation. So apparently this management team couldn‚Äôt be bothered.  If you are from out of town, stay somewhere else (you might have to anyway).","Date of stay: February 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great Experience","The Hilton Hotel, Windhoek, provides excellent service and beautifully appointed accommodation at a great rate, in a very accessible and centralised location. It is the ideal place to unwind after a tough day at the office - or to refresh before embarking on a holiday in Namibia.

"Comfortable rooms, good restaurant, rip off wifi charge","Whilst a Hilton Hotel would not normally be our first choice, it was actually an enjoyable nights stay.The room was a good size with a huge bed which allowed us a comfortable nights sleep.  The bathroom was also of a good size and included both a bath and separate shower and for once, water didn‚Äôt leak all over the room when you used it.We used the coffee shop for an afternoon drink and it has a pleasant outside space ‚Äì but does overlook a car park.As this was a Sunday, the city was quiet and not much was open so we chose to have a drink in the Skybar and dinner in the restaurant.  The Skybar is clearly quiet a trendy space for locals to drink as well as hotel guests and it has a lovely view, although it was windy which didn‚Äôt make it quite so much fun as we‚Äôd hoped.  Not sure I‚Äôd like to eat here either as the food would go cold very quickly.  Dinner in the restaurant was something of a revelation ‚Äì the restaurant is billed as a ‚ÄòGrill‚Äô so we both had steaks and they were excellent both in quality and accuracy of cooking.  It wasn‚Äôt expensive either (for us Londoners).  Staff are a little hit and miss ‚Äì the receptionists aren‚Äôt that enthusiastic about helping ‚Äì we asked them to contact Wilderness Safaris to confirm a pick up but were met with a lofty ‚Äùthere‚Äôs a phone in your room‚Äù.The major criticism is the charge for the wifi.  The cost is ridiculously high ‚Äì it costs more than a steak.  I suspect Hilton get away with this because lots of people are staying here on business and aren‚Äôt paying for it out of their own pocket, however, that really is no justification for ripping people off.","Date of stay: September 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Professioneller Hotelbetrieb auf sehr hohem Niveau","Wir - eine vierk√∂pfige Familie - w√§hlten das Hilton Windhoek f√ºr die erste Nacht in Namibia und - um es kurz zu machen - es war beeindruckend. Bereits der Empfang war professionell, wir wurden trotz unseres fr√ºhen Erscheinens umsorgt und nach kurzem Warten wurde uns unser Zimmer bereits vormittags zur Verf√ºgung gestellt. Die Annehmlichkeiten des Hotels machten es fast schwer, Windhoek zu erkunden. Zu verf√ºhrerisch waren die kulinarischen M√∂glichkeiten, und der Pool auf dem Dach sucht von Lage und Erscheinung seinesgleichen. Das Hilton verk√∂rpert Eleganz und Luxus, nat√ºrlich in der Pr√§gung einer internationalen Kette. Wer die abendliche lange Tafel einer namibischen Guestfarm sucht, wird hier nicht f√ºndig. Hier kann man sich aber nach einem langen Flug und einer schlafarmen Nacht bestens verw√∂hnen lassen.Das Hilton Windhoek hat uns auch in Details √ºberzeugt, nach meinem Eindruck hat es das Zeug, sich mit internationalen Tophotels zu messen. Das alles zu √§u√üerst attraktiven Preisen, seien es die Zimmer selbst, Getr√§nke oder Speisen.Die Architektur im Gro√üen (Lobby und Mezzanine) wie auch im Kleinen (Zimmer) ist modern, attraktiv und ""stylish"" - eventuell etwas austauschbar, dieses Hilton k√∂nnte man auch in einigen anderen St√§dten auch au√üerhalb Afrikas vermuten.Die Klientel ist gemischt, uns erschien es prim√§r als Businesshotel. Spezielle Unterhaltungsprogramme f√ºr Touristen werden halt nicht geboten, aber das braucht hier auch niemand. Die Lage selbst ist so zentral, dass fu√ül√§ufig viel erreicht werden kann. Wer dazu zu m√ºde ist, kann auch einfach von der Dachterrasse aus die Stadt betrachten.Der Restaurantbetrieb war professionell und insbesondere bez√ºglich des Fr√ºhst√ºcks auf einem Stand, den wir so in Namibia nicht wieder vorgefunden haben. Ein kleines Highlight ist die frische Zubereitung von Frucht- und Gem√ºses√§ften nach Wunsch - also keine ""Ceres""-Produkte, wie sie gelegentlich andernorts als ""100 % natural"" angeboten werden.Wir fanden das Hilton derma√üen angenehm, dass wir auch vor unserer Heimreise noch ein paar Stunden zum Mittagessen hier g√∂nnten - und bedauert haben, nicht noch mehr Zeit hier verbringen zu d√ºrfen.","Date of stay: August 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Toller Beginn unserer Reise ","Ein super Cityhotel in zentraler Lager von Windhoek. Wir wurden sehr freundlich begr√º√üt, unsere Zimmer waren bei Ankunft am Mittag noch nicht fertig, also erholten wir uns vom langen Flug auf der Dachterrasse bei gutem Service und Getr√§nken. Auch am Abend genossen wir bei guter Musik ein paar leckere Drinks. Wir hatten standard Zimmer gebucht, Zimmer sind gut ausgestattet und das Bett sehr bequem, Zimmer ist mit einem gro√üz√ºgigen Bad ausgestattet und das wichtigste, alles sehr sauber. Auch das Fr√ºhst√ºck bietet alles was man sich w√ºnscht, ob s√º√üe oder Herzhafte Speisen, sehr leckere S√§fte die einem vor den Augen frisch gepresst werden. √úberall im Hotel war der Service sehr sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend, Daumen hoch ‚úåüèª","Date of stay: February 2020This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A √∫nica coisa que vale a pena √© a localiza√ß√£o","Comparado a outros hot√©is da rede Hilton espalhadas pelo mundo, o hotel Hilton Windhoek √© bem fraco do que diz respeito a estrutura e servi√ßos prestados. Fiquei em duas oportunidades diferentes (e em quartos diferentes) durante a minha road trip pela Nam√≠bia, e nas duas oportunidades tive algum problema com o meu quarto. Banheira/chuveiro com problema, demora na libera√ß√£o do meu checkin (que ocorreu ap√≥s o hor√°rio que o hotel estipula pois segundo a recep√ß√£o, n√£o haviam quartos dispon√≠veis). Mas o pior ocorreu em uma das noites que fiquei hospedado, e fui no bar no t√©rreo do hotel onde deveriam apenas ter acesso os hospedes, por√©m haviam 3 garotas de programa no bar ""assediando"" os estrangeiros. S√©rio isso Hilton? Cade a seguran√ßa dos h√≥spedes? Se entraram garotas de programa, poderiam ter entrado qualquer pessoa l√°. E se eu estivesse com minha familia, filhos? No mais, os produtos e servi√ßos do restaurante e do bar s√£o extremamente caros, e a seguran√ßa em volta do hotel, em especial √† noite, √© horr√≠vel (mas claro, entendo que nesse caso foge da responsabilidade do Hilton, sendo esse um problema p√∫blico). Se resolver sair do hotel para andar a p√© por Windhoek, deixe todos os pertences de valor guardados no cofre, porque com certeza j√° na primeira esquina ir√£o te assediar pedindo dinheiro. O √∫nico ponto positivo √© a cobertura, aonde fica o bar, em que podemos ter uma bela vista da cidade e do por-do-sol.","Date of stay: September 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lock away your possessions if you stay here","I went back to my room unexpectedly and caught one cleaner searching through my bag whilst the other kept watch in the doorway.  I was then made to feel completely overwhelmed in a security meeting where the cleaners denied everything and accused me of not being truthful!!!   Security Managers words, 'there's nothing we can do about this'.  I did receive an apology email from the General Manager but only after I complained at a higher level.Soooo disappointed as I'm in and out of Windhoek all the time and always previously looked forward to staying here.

"En noget blandet oplevelse","Hotellet er rigtigt dejligt, og v√¶relset med egen have p√• 6. sal var ogs√• super. Servicen p√• hotellet er derimod en noget blandet oplevelse. Vi spiste i sushi og winebaren. De havde et super vinkort, men da vi ville bestille vin, var beskeden at alle vinskabene var lukket, s√• vi kunne kun f√• husets vin. Efter nogle protester og lang ventetid kom der en chef med en n√∏gle, s√• vi kunne f√• vores vin. Sushien var fin nok, men samlet tog det over 2 timer at spise lidt sushi og drikke en flaske vin - det er meget lang tid. Alene at f√• en flaske vand tog en halv time. At der p√• s√• fancy et hotel ikke var en h√•rt√∏rrer p√• v√¶relset kan undre.","Date of stay: September 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Neat and tidy","The hotel is well located, with great views. The Hilton has a standard when it comes to cleanliness, service and rooms and I think they hit their mark here. Disappointed to not see seafood in the restaurant and a dangerously priced mini bar that might be fine for the foreign market but way off mark for the regional market. The visit is not complete with a drink in the evening at the Skybar. Breakfast choices at cost benefit ratio slightly below par. Shower roof either had soap sud or mould that is not easily noticable to the naked eye. Having said all this and knowing the current hotel brands in town, you will be hard pressed to find a more luxurious hotel.","Date of stay: August 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Also a plus is the Hertz car rental agency which is located directly in the building. The internet was a bit slow (like probably everywhere in Namibia) and the room a bit small but everything else was fine. Especially the breakfast buffet was excellent (healthy fresh juices, directly prepared in front of the guests, various fresh egg options, delicious bread (even ""Bretzeln"") plus muffins and coffee/tea ""to go"" at the entrance).

"Very disappointing and unpleasant stay for a hotel in 5 star category","For the standard which Hilton should offer worldwide, I consider this hotel very very poor.  It was mainly about the details, but altogether it was so many of them that they created a bad impression. In the room,  AC did not work at nights and most of the day! although we ask to fix it repeatedly. We could not sleep all nights. Management just explained that ALL rooms at one floor either cool or all heat and since there were some which want to heat we can not cool. It means that In this hotel, AC or heating could be only set up centrally. Riticulous! Hair dryer blows only cold air. No slippers, no bathrobes. Windows dirty from inside... electronic keys had to be constantly recharged couple of times a day, sometimes we only got one towel insted of four, etc. Cleaning ladies are very noisy in the corridors and were smashing doors from their storage constantly, so one can hear it all the time while in the room. First day we were told that we have to pay for breakfast, although we have paid for B&B. When complained, it was fixed at the reception. And watch ou! There is no free wi-fi. Wi-fi is charged! And it does not work well either. Altogether, services are on the level of three if not two star hotel (and I apologise to all well managed three star hotels and those who are helpful in this hotel.)","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Uncomfortable experience at an otherwise great hotel","I booked well in advance for a twin bed room as I was sharing with another male colleague. When he arrived first, he was shown to the room and there was only one King bed. He enquired and was told a twin bed room was not available even though we had booked such and it was confirmed. He knew I was to arrive at midnight, so he want and found a hostel to stay. When I arrived I learned of this and was told a twin room as we booked was not available. You don't want to learn this at midnight. We stayed for two nights. The twin room was also not given to us for the second night. I am highly embarrassed that my work colleague had to go out and find and pay for a backpackers hostel for his two nights that we were there together for work. This was handled very poorly by the hotel staff there.  Otherwise - room was nice and hotel is great and staff are friendly.

"Looks good from the outside....but the staff ruins it.","While the building itself is nice and the rooms are large with comfortable beds, the staff is not responsive in most cases and desperately needs training in how to properly run a hotel and restaurants.  I stayed for 12 nights on business and n 8 of those days when my room was serviced - the maid forgot towels and in some cases the toiletries. In each case when I called the front desk it took a very long time (up to an hour) to get towels.  Additionally after checking in I requested additional hangers for my work clothes - it took four calls and a trip to the front desk to get the hangers....and the look on the staffs face indicated that I had interrupted a very important chat with their mates at the front desk.  This was the theme of the hotel - they loved talking to each other but doing their jobs, not so much.  In the bar where I ate dinner on 6 nights - it was a major inconvenience to ask for a beer, a menu or to get the bill and it was not just me - every person that came in and sat at the bar had to ask for everything - the staff not once asked the patron if they needed anything.  Oh, and the bar staff definitely like to sample the drinks they make for the customers, especially the fruity blender drinks - there was always some left over for the staff to share.  I travel for a living and travel in Africa almost exclusively and while this is one of the nicest buildings I have seen, the staff ruins it.  In a country where the cost of waitstaff is affordable there is plenty of personnel - it is the apparent total lack of training and oversight that ruins it.  I also used the gym almost every day - if you can call it a gym.  Two treadmills, two ellipticals and a bike...a few dumbbells and some mats.  The equipment is in need of repair and there is no ventilation in the gym (it stinks like a locker room).  I would recommend staying at the Avani or another hotel in Windhoek where the staff are better trained, more responsive and actually care if you need something.  With considerable training and better management this could be a great hotel, they are just not there yet.","Date of stay: August 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The service was excellent, the staff were all really helpful, the food was good, the rooms were spacious and comfortable and the public areas were very light airy and welcoming. We will definitely return to this hotel.","Date of stay: April 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very good indeed, thumbs up!","I have read some mixed reviews on Tripadvisor so I was a bit curious what to expect. After two nights stay my verdict is clear: This is a gem and THE place to stay at when visiting Windhoek. This just three year old hotel is very very good.I had a ""Executive room"" which was very nice, clean and modern on the 8th floor. This room gives you access to a nice Executive lounge on the 9th floor with complimentary drinks and snacks. I did read about some complaints about the limited breakfast offering in the lounge. Why not have the full breakfast and pay for it if this isn't enough? I mean it's not very expensive and the lounge simply doesn't have the room nor the facilities for a full English breakfast.The outdoor Skybar at the 9th floor is excellent and with impressive views of the city. Here you also find a pool and lounge area. The Kalabar Bar at the Mezzanine level has an outdoor terrace and a simple but good food menu.God knows I have stayed at many hotels including Hiltons all over the World, this is in the top League. I find some reviews a bit disturbing, be nice to the staff and tip them and you will be treated well, I mean it's not difficult and the standard for any luxury hotel in the World.My only complaint is directed to the senior management staff. Where are you? You should be visible in the hotel supporting and helping your staff. Not hiding behind the door at the reception. The staff is very good and deserves a more proactive and supporting senior management.I will for sure be back at Hilton the next time I'm in Windhoek.","Date of stay: December 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good hotel but could do better.","We stayed here for 4 nights at the start of our holiday and one night at the end. Our checkin experience after a long flight was not a good one. The reception staff asked me to sign for a much higher room rate than I had booked. They also said that breakfast was not included. It was only when I produced evidence from the Hilton website that they agreed to honour the booking terms. We were then given a room beside an elevator and facing noisy roadworks. It took 3 telephone calls to get a room change. A further point is that the charge for WiFi is the highest I have experienced at any hotel. On the positive side the restaurant and bars are well staffed and the food is good. The breakfast buffet is great and the cook who makes the eggs is an asset. The rooms are clean and well appointed.","Date of stay: July 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Wonderful place to start or end your trip","Very central hotel. Very clean. Great rooftop bar/restaurant. Good live music in the evening in the restaurant. The breakfast buffet was wonderful. The bathrooms are incredible.... Although not very private but I was alone so it was not an issue for me. The internet could have been better, but this is true in most of the country. It wad a little of a challenge as I was there for work. I tried to try the spa 3 times, but it was always fully booked... Book ahead.","Date of stay: February 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Incompetent Staff and Terrible Business Facilities","This is my second stay at the Hilton Windhoek and the experience just keeps getting worse and worse. The only reason I was booked there was because the Windhoek Country Club was fully booked. The Staff at the Hilton Windhoek are incompetent and very junior. My Check out of the hotel took nearly 30 minutes because the person conducting the check out did not know how to split invoices or how the credit card machine worked. I tried to get documents scanned and it took almost 2 hours because they did not know how to scan documents. Out of frustration, I went somewhere else where it only took me 5 minutes. You can also start seeing the neglect in maintenance in the rooms. The carpet was starting to look dirty. That doesn't bother me too much though. The mini-bar was never restocked after I had been there for 2 days. If I can recommend a hotel, rather go to the Windhoek Country Club, because their service and business facilities are excellent. They have competent and efficient Staff and their price is slightly cheaper than the Hilton Windhoek.","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great New Luxury Downtown Location","I stayed here for 6 nights on a business trip to Windhoek, Namibia. This is a brand-new modern hotel in a great central downtown location. I stayed up on the Club Floor, and had access to the typical Hilton Lounge for nightly snacks and drinks. Rooms were large, modern and spacious,and the food at breakfast was hearty with a large variety. There are several restaurants in the hotel, plus room services also offers a great variety, I used both options.The Hotel offers underground secure parking if you have a car rental. Its locations in downtown allows for easy access to all parts of the city, and is very well serviced by both taxis and buses. The Views of the entire city are amazing from the Club lounge as this is a tall Building on the side of a hill as compared to the rest of the downtown city center, and even better views of the entire region can be seen from the upper deck infinity Pool and sky-top Bar. The staff was very friendly and always willing and able to assist.","Date of stay: August 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First Time to Windhoek","This is a modern hotel with well appointed rooms. The lap pool and the sky bar is a nice place to relax and has a good atmosphere and service. The bar on the Mezzanine level is also fun with music and again a good atmosphere. Close to the centre of town and probably the best place in the capital.Friendly service, breakfast was everything you could want. The restaurant though at Dinner was very slow service (from the kitchen) which let it down as the waiter service was all you could ask for. Over all it was a good place to stay.","Date of stay: October 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice building, very good rooftop bar. Avoid the club and the restaurant","Hilton WindhoekHilton Windhoek is a relative new 9-floor building. It stucks out in Windhoek and is easy to find. The building and the rooms are modern and very good. The rooftop bar has a good view over Windhoek and a nice pool area too.The service is slow. We had dinner and breakfast in the main restaurant and it was disappointing. They forgot our starters and where very slow.We lived in a clubroom and the room was good but the service in the clubroom was terrible, with almost nothing to eat or drink ‚Äì haven‚Äôt seen a cheaper club ever.Conclusion: Nice building, very good rooftop bar.

"Best hotel I have ever been in!","I was only in Windhoek for one night on business.  I was suffering from flu, so was really hoping that the accomodation would be decent.  Much to my surprise, I was greeted by a Mercedes-Benz to drive me to the hotel.  There were other guests who had also arrived on my flight and were staying at the Hilton and they were also picked up....but in their own Mercedes.  I arrived and they quickly checked me in.  It was when I opened the door to my room......wow!  A good size, with an amazing bathtub (perfect for my achy flu) and all the amenities you would need.  The bed.....the most amazing comfortable bed ever.  The food was beyond what I normally expect in Southern African countries and the staff were so helpful.  This is a new hotel, and I have to say that I am normally cautious of new hotels because of all the kinks and new staff...but the staff at the Hilton in Windhoek are definitley top class.  For a weary business traveller....this Hilton nin Windhoek is a dream.","Date of stay: November 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"In die Jahre gekommen!","Bisher war dieses Hotel bei allen unseren bisherigen Aufenthalten in Windhoek erste Wahl.Beim jetzigen Aufenthalt tr√ºbten einige Unzul√§nglichkeiten den Eindruck. Man sieht und merkt dem Haus und den Zimmern deutlich an, dass M√§ngeln entweder nicht oder nur ungen√ºgend nachgegangen wird. Das Mobiliar ist veraltet, teilweise abgesto√üen,  Gardinen sind nicht mehr vollst√§ndig angebracht, der F√∂n war defekt, das B√ºgeleisen fehlte g√§nzlich, der Duschkopf war ebenfalls defekt. Alles nur kleinere M√§ngel, in Summe aber f√ºr solch ein Haus zu viele.Das Personal sollte in Serviceleistungen und auch im Umgang mit G√§sten besser geschult werden. In einem 5-Sterne-Haus w√§re zumindest ein Ausdruck des Bedauerns zu erwarten, wenn man jeden Tag - an einem auch mehrmals- die Schl√ºsselkarte neu codieren lassen muss, weil diese nicht funktioniert. In Sachen Sauberkeit gibt es absolut nichts zu kritisieren, die Betten sind bequem und das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist noch immer eine Empfehlung.Alles in allem ein diesmal leider zwiesp√§ltiger Gesamteindruck.","Date of stay: May 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappointing stay","We decided to stay in the Hilton on our last night in Namibia after a long road trip. Room was decent and reception staff was friendly. Unfortunately, the spa was closed when we were there, the 'heated' outdoor pool was ice-cold. We decided to have cocktails on the rooftop which was a disappointment (though the view of the city is great). The three man staff were clowning around, it took them 45 mins to serve us a gin-tonic and martini. They did charge us only one drink, but their attitude was not really what you'd expect in this kind of a hotel.","Date of stay: August 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lovely hotel in the center of Windhoek, close to the Arts Center, the Christukirche and other attractions.","This is a nice way to get introduced to WDH - and to Namibia in general. We had a lovely room with a view of the surrounding mountains. The breakfast is sumptuous (don't miss the freshly-squeezed fruit juice) and the rooftop bar offers unparalleled views of the city, the hills. At sunset, the views are sublime and in darkness, the stars and several planets come to life (remember that this is a desert with clear skies, so the views are crisp). Also, remember that this is a desert, so it can get very cold at night, so take a good jacket when you're on the rooftop.My only gripe was that the Wi-Fi was dead due to some serious technical issues. Luckily we were able to get a Namibian SIM card, so we were able to have conference calls using that SIM. However, I will give credit to the manager Hilya who was very professional about the situation and gave us a small break on the room rates to make up for the inconvenience.","Date of stay: September 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Fine, but not usual Hilton standards","The hotel is fine, and undoubtedly one of the best in Windhoek. But don't get your hopes us. Rooms have nicely renovated bathrooms but still have creepy, dirty carpets and furniture from the 80s. (You'll want onto use the slippers). Breakfast buffet is fine, but water for tea was lukewarm, flask for hot milk empty, boiled eggs not quite cooked. Hint: they tell you there is no cappuccino/latte but if you insist one appears. Sky bar has lively view, gym is small but good.","Date of stay: September 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good and bad","Ideally located in the city centre with secure parking. The rooms are large, well designed, furnished and equipped. The restaurant is good.However, the problem is that the management just seems to have gone missing. We had problems with the hot water system, whilst the airconditioning was pre=set at an uncomfortable warm. The internet was effectively inoperative - both the general access and the preferential honors service which we were offered in view of the problems with the former. Finally, the room service was chaotic.","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Excellent hotel - clean and great food!","I was in Namibia for a week, including 2 nights in Windhoek. I stayed at the Hilton both nights and it was great. The hotel is modern and clean with nice rooms and great showers. There are a few restaurants in the hotel - the buffet was great for breakfast! The rooftop patio is excellent - it gives you a great view of the city and serves lovely drinks. Make sure you try the burger - Namibia is known for its beef and I think the burger the Hilton serves is the best I've ever had. I would highly recommend the Hilton if you have to spend any time in Windhoek.","Date of stay: June 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Guter Start f√ºr unsere Namibia-Rundreise","Das Hilton liegt sehr zentral, so dass wir die Innenstadt gut zu Fu√ü erkunden konnten. Unser Mietwagen stand sicher in der Tiefgarage (geringe zus√§tzliche Geb√ºhr). Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Zugang zur Executive Lounge. Dort bekommt man den ganzen Tag, von 18 - 20 Uhr auch alkoholische Getr√§nke. Man kann dort auch fr√ºhst√ºcken und abends gibt es ein kleines B√ºffet mit warmen und kalten Speisen. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck haben wir aufgrund der gr√∂√üeren Auswahl lieber im Hauptrestaurant eingenommen. Das Abendessen reicht aus, um nicht noch zus√§tzlich Essen gehen zu m√ºssen. Das Essen im Restaurant und in der Executive Lounge war gut. Obwohl wir bereits morgens im Hotel angekommen sind, konnten wir unser Zimmer beziehen und uns vom Nachtflug aus Deutschland erholen. Unser Fazit: das Hilton ist ein guter Start- oder Endpunkt f√ºr eine Namibia-Rundreise.","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lovely end to the trip around Namibia","The room was spacious, with the expected amenities, such as:~fridge~hairdryer~safe~bath & showerThere was also aircon, however was quite intermittent. When working, it cooled the room, however it stayed on for a maximum of 1 hour. Once turned off, the room became stuffy and clammy, however upon departure, we became aware that the left hand window could be opened slightly. This is likely to relieve some of the issues, however I am not sure if you would want these open over night, as bugs could fly in.The staff in the lobby were faultless, upon arrival they were smiley, and loaded our bags onto the trolley to take the luggage to the room. Breakfast was stunning, with an incredible array of food. In fact, they were the only place that served English sausages, as well as another type of sausage. Pastries and cakes were freshly baked every morning, as well as smoothies mixed with fresh fruit before your very eyes. There is also a rooftop swimming pool, which is very nice, however not the best for wanting to do lengths, as it is so slim. Although, there is a well equipped gym, that has weights, cardio machines as well as space for personal floor workouts on fitness mats.All in all a lovely stay, rooms up-to-date.","Date of stay: April 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"sehr gut gef√ºhrtes Stasdthotel","Anfang Februar √ºbernachteten wir zu Beginn unserer Reise 2 N√§chte in einem Zimmer mit Lounge-excess. Check-in war etwas langsam, aber freundlich.Das Zimmer, sehr gro√ü und ger√§umig, war gut eingerichtet. Der Blick wundersch√∂n √ºber die doch etwas verschlafene Stadt. Das haben wir noch keinem der vielen Hilton-hotels erlebt: wir erhielten erst einmal einen Voucher f√ºr einen welcome drink "" whatever you like"" und wir lie√üen es uns gut gehen auf der h√ºbschen Terrasse. Leider regnete etwas  am Abend.Ferner erhielten wir noch einen Gutschein f√ºr 1 Person f√ºr das gro√üe Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet,was wir aber dort nicht eingenommen haben. Wir fr√ºhst√ºckten in der Lounge, das kleine Buffet war absolut ok. Weniger gut war der Abend - Imbiss"". Nachdem ich das √ºbliche Hiltonformuar ausf√ºllt habe und hier√ºber meine klare Meinung mitgeteilt habe, fanden wir am Ende unserer Reise - wir √ºbernachten nochmals 1 Nacht - ein gut gef√ºlltes,kleines Buffet vor. Ung√ºnstig: es gab Oxtail was ja stets viele,kleine Knochen hat und l√§ngst nicht vielen Menschen mundet. Die Sauce war k√∂stlich, das Fleisch knallhart. √úbrigens war der check-in jetzt schaurig und √ºberhaupt nicht Hilton-like oder Namibia gem√§√ü. Das mag eine Ausnahme sein. Herrlich ist der gro√üe pool hoch oben auf dem Dach. Allerdings gibt es kaum Platz f√ºr Hotelg√§ste, da die Jeunesse d'or√© der Stadt sich enorm breit macht und auch laut ist.grunds√§tzlich ist man √ºberall im Hotel sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Wir k√∂nnen das Haus, fussl√§ufig zur Innenstadt mit eigener Tiefgarage, absolut empfehlen.","Date of stay: February 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A welcomed relaxing","We had just returned from a 6 day trip around Namibia which was very interesting but tiring and then we checked into the Hilton.   We were upgraded to a garden room on the 5th floor which was lovely (except for the building work next door) but it was good to open the patio door and enjoy the wonderful weather.   There is a good small pool on the roof level and the water was a perfect temperature.

"Central and modern","A nice hotel in an interesting city.  Centrally located.  I was here on business and there were a few frustrations in this regard.  I can't believe a 5-star property charges for internet, especially not at the business end of the market!  Surely business travellers need reliable fast internet included in their room rate?  Secondly, breakfast on Saturdays start later... not great for those that need to be up early.  That said, rooms were spacious, well appointed and afforded nice views of downtown Windhoek.  The pool on the roof provides space to unwind.   I found it easy to walk to the central business district from the hotel - and even to some of the sights.  I would stay here again.","Date of stay: November 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Really disappointed....","The chain of Hilton hotels around the world are famous very popular. I booked a 3 night stay at Hilton Windhoek in Namibia and it was a big big  disappointment. I could call it a desastre if we take into account that we are talking about ""the Hilton hotel"".Let first give you the good side of it. The hotel is well located in the city center which is a positive aspect.Another positive thing is the hotel name which can make you feel posh when talking to your friend. Well that is all about positive aspectsNow the negative ones....First at the check in. I used 3 different credit cards that were declined. Had to take cash from an ATM machine and pay.The room were not bad but were small.There was something wrong with the bathtub. While using it, the water leaked out flooding the entire bathroom.The most ridiculous thing is the parking. Guests have to pay for parking. This is absurd and never seem happening before.The internet is charge. Please, at this point in time, internet is not luxury, it is a must. I don't recall the last time I paid for a internet in a hotel.The room service... well that was as well a big failure. It was clear that they never changed the bed sheet.I mean, that was a big disappointment from me.Last but not least, I booked the room through Booking.com and during the booking it was mentioned that the room includes breakfast but when I arrived, I was informed that I had to pay for the breakfast. Seriously?In conclusion, I do not recommend this hotel. You can get better services ( free internet, parking etc ) for the same price or lower. Do not let the name fool you. Unfortunately it did fool me but never again.","Date of stay: November 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton is standard. ","Arriving on a Thursday at 14hoo only to be told that rooms were not ready is annoying?The beds as per usual were very comfortable and the usage of space for the bathrooms was excellent. A bit disappointed with the lack of maintenance in the rooms. There was free wifi..The Hilton breakfasts are excellent and should not be missed. Ample parking for all. Staff at the Skybar were very helpful and the pool area well furnished and a good way to spend an hour or two.","Date of stay: November 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton hotel Windhoek","I stayed for 1 night before a trip around Namibia. The hotel is comfortable as Hilton is everywhere. The room is very spacious, I had a standard room, a big bathroom, shampoo, hair conditioner and body lotion. Coffee, tea, a kettle in the room. Sufficient breakfast. Wifi is for extra fee, if you are not a member of Hilton Honours loyalty program. It worked in the room very bad, and I had troubles to connect in the lobby too. Nice, helpful staff. Comfortable stay.","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Faulty Towers without the charm, but there is hope","The main and only five star business hotel in Windhoek - and it behaves marginally better than a government monopoly.  No attention to details, service slow, staff unable to make a difference even if they wanted.This time, my room was not ready until 7pm despite having tried to check in at 1pm. 2pm is what my reservation says. Then, room key did not work, the gym and spa were blocked because of some event, room service took forever, and no one offered anything material but excuses. Next morning, early, but of course the car booked the previous evening was not there. These are easy fixes, and the hotel is basically sound, were there interest. But there is hope. Another large luxury hotel is being built next door. So hold your trip for a year or two if these things above matter.Namibia and Windhoek are worth the trip though","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very Good Hotel for Business","When I come for business to Windhoek The Hilton is the preferred Hotel. It is easy to find coming from the airport, not much GPS needed. It is still very central. If you need a break you can easily stroll down the road to get to the center for some shopping or you walk the other way to see some landmarks like the Fort for example. The staff is always super friendly. I also like the lounge area with the little coffee shop, which offers the opportunity to meet with business friends and discuss in a nice atmosphere with really good coffee. The rooms are very clean and well equipped just what I expect from Hilton Hotels. This time I attended the first conference held at the Hilton in Windhoek and it was a very good experience as well.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Vriendelijke chauffeur en ook zeer vriendelijk personeel bij de check-in. Ruime en sfeervolle kamer, zeer comfortabel groot bed en heerlijke regendouche. Kamer kon op details wat netter in de afwerking, maar heeft mij niet gestoord. Ontbijt was fantastische, keuze te over en omeletten made to order. Het hotel heeft een prachtige bar op de 9e etage met een mooi uitzicht over de stad, heerlijke cocktails en een zwembad met ligbedden.

"Comfortable visit, some attention to detail missing","This is my 3rd stay at this hotel.  It's in a central location to the main business areas in Windhoek and the rooms are comfortable.  Staff are friendly and assist where they can (great effort in getting me an additional night) but some things are starting to slip:- HHonnors membership.  I joined this programme during my first visit and on the second stay the team found my membership details without me having to supply any details.  This time around I was informed that they needed my membership details, which is a pity as Wi-Fi didn't connect and I couldn't find the details- Towels.  Attention to ensuring hand towels are provided in the rooms (was there on the first and third day but not on the second) will ensure less wastage as guests wouldn't need to use the bigger towels- Additional hairdryers.  I requested a hairdryer as the room didn't have one and after a wait of almost an hour gave up and checked out.  Different staff gave different reasons as to the delay.  It is highly recommended to ensure that there are additional hairdryers available as these things to break and, in this instance, wasn't in the roomA bit of a conflicting experience, which is a pity as the hotel has ongoing potential and the central location is a major plus","Date of stay: June 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My stay 2016...oh sorry, I didn't even get that far.","I would love to report my experience regarding my stay at this supposedly high standard hotel but due to the extremely non-existent customer service I have not even been able to book...I am a UK resident and tried to book a reservation via the hotel website as per the process - filling in an inquiry form with a promise you will receive a response imminently with a quote and then you can proceed with your booking. However, despite sending two inquiry forms I have still yet to receive a response approximately 2 weeks later. For a popular chain of hotel this inadequate service is shocking. I can only surmise that the reservations team are on holiday or they are so popular with people wanting to stay there they simply do not care to respond to let me know they are full...Suffice it to say, I have moved on and booked elsewhere. The Olive Exclusive and other hotels I made inquiries with responded immediately and certainly within 12 hours never mind 24.

"Poderia ser melhor por ser Hilton","O hotel √© grande, moderno, linda decora√ß√£o nas √°reas comuns, mas nos decepcionou. O sinal do wifi √© muito ruim no quarto e s√≥ √© bom nas √°reas comuns, mais pr√≥ximo do restaurante. A princ√≠pio, no login, est√° escrito que voc√™ ir√° pagar N$186 d√≥lares da Nam√≠bia por dia, ao final nem cobraram, mas como n√£o avisaram, fiquei um per√≠odo sem internet! Outra coisa que nos decepcionou √© que o concierge n√£o foi muito simp√°tico conosco para nos ajudar com um motorista e com um passeio. Contudo, o quarto √© confort√°vel, eles d√£o duas garrafinhas de √°gua de cortesia e a mo√ßa do quarto vem duas vezes por dia para ver se est√° tudo em ordem. N√£o nos arriscamos a andar a p√© no entorno do hotel para fazer nada, com um pouco de receio e porque n√£o √© uma regi√£o bonita e acolhedora. O caf√© da manh√£ tamb√©m √© muito bom, com muitas op√ß√µes quentes, frios muito bons, frutas excelentes e gostosos p√£es.

"No Honour at this Hilton  ","Booked long in advance was excited about my stay. My requests for room preference were not met, some phoney excuse offered up. hilton honours member but no rewards. Told they would move me when room became available, that never came. Every day I asked just a different reason why not. Construction across street stated work at 6am, noisy beyond belief also traffic noise on lower floor starts at 5.30am. B&B package apparently does not include breakfast or parking or wifi. It seemed I had to try & negotiate everything again on a daily basis. Now don't let this take away from the room size or the unique walk in shower & bathroom. Staff in each of the 4 places to eat were mostly very good, sky bar was worst of 4 I tried. Even have a sushi bar, a little shocking but not bad. Turn down service at 8pm nice touch with chocolate. Security probably necessity but when trying to leave parking even with ticket thought the guy was just plain angry at me because gate didn't work with tickets, they had to override manually. The only reason to choose this hotel is if you need down town. I saw what colleagues gift for almost 1/2 my price paid and very even more upset. Watch your final bill, I was 3rd in line & each had charges we should not be paying. I give it 2 stars for fantastic food & some real nice staff in food service.","Date of stay: August 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice property, some minor issues","We spent a night here with another couple while transiting from Swakopmund to Victoria Falls. This hotel does seem to be the one business hotel in Windhoek, capital of Namibia.The large bed was very comfortable. The room has a personal safe for valuables and it had the amenities you'd expect from a Hilton Hotel.We had two minor issues during our stay: 1) The security lock inside our room door had been broken which made us a little nervous, although we had no problems.2) When we checked-in the woman on reception didn't want to/wasn't able to find my wife's Hilton Honours number to link to our stay and was completely unhelpful in trying to do so. But shortly afterwards a different, trainee reception desk, staff member quickly found the required number and linked it to our booking. There are choices for in-house dining; we ate bar food at the casual deck area, and later had dinner in the main restaurant. Both meals were fine but nothing special.It's disappointing when major hotel chains charge for wifi access in the room as internet access is a traveller's requirement these days, and Hilton Windhoek does charge for in-room access. You can access wifi for free in the public areas if the access code works - we went through several trips to reception until we finally got one that worked.If you are travelling via Windhoek's international airport allow sufficient time to get there from the Hilton - it's a 40 km long taxi or shuttle drive.","Date of stay: April 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Like the Curate's egg","The Hilton in Windhoek is line the Curate's egg - good in parts. The rooms are very good being spacious, clean, well equipped and with really wonderfully comfortable beds and good showers. It is however a shame that no beer, wine or spirits are available from the mini bar - this the Hilton is behaving like a third rate B&B, not trusting either the guest, it staff or systems to manage alcohol beverages. The breakfast is good, the service less so. Dinner is again a mixed affair. My Pan died Line fish was bizarrely served on what looked and tasted lime rice pudding. The staff are pleasant and helpful, though service delivery is very hit and miss. Breakfast room service ordered for 7am failed to arrive by 7:30 despite a call to remind them at 7:10. Nuts ordered at the stunning sky bar took 45 minutes to materialise and then turned out to be popcorn. Getting tea or coffee served at breakfast was a challenge, the hotel ran out of still water in rooms, restaurants and bars as it did for 2/3rds of the red wines on the wine list. The barman at the 1st floor bar kept wandering off for 10 minutes at a time and the lifts were somewhat erratic - then again TIA as those who know Africa well say. What was really unacceptable was the state of the Sky Bar area around the pool and the gym in the early morning. Dirty plates, broken glass, overturned furniture etc. a disgrace at at hotel.

"Hilton Windhoek / Good business hotel","Did not have a chance to spend much time there, but would recommend this hotel - very comfortable and modern bedrooms. Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to try out the restaurant on this trip but hope to do so in the future. I will definitely return to this hotel!","Date of stay: February 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great hotel, excellent breakfast & very good staff.","We stayed for four nights. This Hilton is very well run & the staff are on the whole excellent.The breakfast is outstanding & room service is good. The pizzas were much better than expected.The pool bar has quite slow service and had run out of white wine when we visited on a Saturday afternoon. Our baby was sick & the reception & restaurant team could not have been more helpful.","Date of stay: February 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"An oasis when visiting over December ","The staff was very friendly, the hotel really beautiful and neat. Rooms are spacious and luxurious. The sky bar and swimming pool has an extraordinary view, cold beer and really an oasis when you arrive at noon in summer. Only problem was that a roller bed was not provided and the kids did not sleep well. We took it up with management the next day and the only explanation could be that one staff member slipped up. Apology excepted. The breakfast buffet is world class. Would highly recommend. It was a wonderful stay.","Date of stay: December 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Five Star Service and very Friendly Staff","Centrally located in downtown Windhoek. In walking distance to some very nice restaurants. The executive rooms are stylish and spacious and the beds are very comfortable. Very attentive and friendly staff. The pool bar is a phantastic hang out for a sundowner.Just one thing on the lows: the executive lounge is tiny and the breakfast there is very poor.Otherwise, the hotel is highly recommended!!","Date of stay: December 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A TRUE FIND IN AFRICA","My time in Windhoek was really made easier and more pleasurable having found and stayed here during my time in Namibia.  The food was wonderful and the staff was extremely helpful.  The people in Namibia were also friendly and very kind.  The management staff always handled situations promptly and very professionally.  I stayed there for three months and had a wonderful time.  Thanks to all the hard working staff. The sky bar had a beautiful view.","Date of stay: May 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"End in luxury","Our last night in Namibia was great! We arrived here at 15h and enjoyed the roof swimmingpool & bar with drinks and bites.At night we ate great sushi at the D'vine bar, the staff is very friendly and they have a high service level. Because this hotel is in the city center it is easy to go shopping.We checked out late and went to the airport very relaxed.There is some construction across the hotel but we didn't hear any noise from that.The whole city is very quiet at night.","Date of stay: November 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great food but some kinks to be ironed out","I stayed here in April 2014 on a   business trip. The hotel is new and thus lots of kinks still needed to be ironed out. My shower cubicle flooded, one glass wall on the side of the atrium came shattering down one evening and it was just the grace of God that there was no one standing nearby as they would've been seriously injured. The food was pretty good, however the service in the main restaurant would vary from very good to downright odd. The rooms are spacious with lovely views of the CBD and the wifi was decent. I'd go back again.","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton Windhoek.","Hi all, Probably the best place to stay in Windhoek, its centrally located, staff are really friendly and helpful.HighlightsManagement are involved and always visible.Rooms are spacious.Showers are awesome. Modern look and feel leaves you energetic. Friendly waiter in the ekipa resturantThursday buffet (Indian night) is the best. Lo-lightsThe room service menu need improvement, the portions are small. A colleague had a room that was a bit musty. (Mine was perfect)The cost of staying here is becoming increasingly high. With the current economic pressures businesses are reducing travel allowances making eating and drinking at the Hilton difficult. Staff need to be trained on the Hilton honours program. (I enquired about benefits and the front desk were unclear).","Date of stay: August 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not living up to International standards","Comparing the pricing of a garden suite to other local accommodation within the same price range has one wondering what the fuss is all about. Maintenance is not done to the exacting standard one came to expect from this group. Outside parking is a nightmare and not only due to the ongoing construction activities in the area. The ablution facilities at reception had neither hand towels nor toiletpaper. One of the lifts was out of order, the aerial photographs mounted against the walls damaged and clearly in need of replacement. The coffee is tired and the breakfast much ado about nothing. The ground personnel were friendly but seem to lack experience. It took a considerable time to trace our pre-paid booking and proof of payment had to be presented before the actual booking could be traced.As a parting note I find it a bit needy that the Hilton could not provide free Wifi access for its clientele... A bit of a let down for Namibia and a clear indication that a name is just that - a name and not necessarily indicative of the elegance and sophistication associated with the marketing hype...","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Unplanned stay at the Hilton Windhoek","We were had an unplanned stay in the Hilton, Windhoek, this due to missing our flights back to SA. After an 11 hour driving ordeal in getting from Soosusvlei to Windhoek due to flooding, we missed our flights back to SA. We arrived at the Hilton just before 10pm. We were assisted by staff, and special arrangements were made to accommodate us and offer us a meal in the executive lounge, even after closing time. Staff stayed on to ensure that we were accommodated and comfortable after our ordeal. This hotel is of a very high standard, and rooms are superb. This would definitely be our hotel of choice in Windoek.","Date of stay: March 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Overall good experience, but....","The Hilton is very conveniently located in that it is close to restaurants and shopping, and has beautiful views.  It also has an excellent breakfast, with mostly accomodating staff (Peter is a gem).    I did have issues resolving the internet problems and charges (was supposed to be part of my package), and my first room hadn't been prepared for the next guest (though this was quickly resolved).    The rooms were clean, secure, and mostly with the amenities one would expect on a business stay.  I will definitely stay here again, and tell others about it.","Date of stay: February 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Das Hotel liegt im Zentrum, Gesch√§fte und Restaurants k√∂nnen zu Fu√ü erreicht werden. Die Gegend wirkte auf mich sicher. Besonders gut zum Fr√ºhst√ºck: frisch gepresste Obst- und Gem√ºses√§fte, die man selbst zusammenstellen kann und im Entsafter zubereitet werden.

"They much try much harder to reach 5 star level!","We stayed last week 3 nights in Hilton Windhoek. It felt like all the time this hotel was teasing us in a negative way not to enjoy our stay here. Many things are not working here, communication between staff and operational director Teun Engbers, is not working well. Also Teun gives the impression he will help you, but finally he is doing nothing.Ok there was a strike of staff, but some things had nothing to do with that strike. Why is still on your website Mr Teun that you have complimentary wifi which you do not have?Why guests are just sending out of the pool because they was a private party, it was really rude. Breakfast was different every day, the nice bread of one day just was not there the next day, pancakes finished and so on. On day of departure  late check out was first free of charge, later 50 % of our room rate on which we agreed, but when we were at the pool on our last day staff came up to inform us that is was much higher because it was 50 % of the rate of that day which was much higher. We saw people complaining at reception about many things. I would not stay here again because you can not rely on their quality, you can not rely on their promise that the pool is open and so on.","Date of stay: December 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Extremely comfy, but service varies...","I recently spent a week at the Hilton in Windhoek for business.  The hotel was incredibly comfortable for the business traveler:  amazing bed with sleek sheets and quality bedding, great blackout curtains, strong air conditioning that never faltered (amazing for such a hot place!), reliable wifi, and a gorgeous bathroom.  The bathtub was perfectly sized for soaking and the shower was powerful.  Even the hair dryer in the room blew me away - the mamba has to be the best in-room hair dryer EVER.Praise should also be heaped upon the dining options in the hotel.  The breakfast buffet was incredibly delicious.  I loved the variety of foods, especially the fresh smoothies and juices (omg, orange and pineapple!).  Specialty coffees can be ordered (cappuccinos, lattes, etc). and there is a variety of tea available, although I must say that the filter coffee was delish. The yogurt and fruits (both fresh and dry) rounded out a delightful breakfast each morning.  My colleague and I decided to dine in one night (we walked to Sardinia around the corner every other night, but it is closed on Tuesdays) and were delightfully surprised at the healthy menu offerings in the main restaurant.  I enjoyed a grilled chicken breast (on the bone!) with fresh grilled veggies and peri-peri sauce.  Also of note was the amazing wine list, which featured several South African winners.  I adore SA wine so was pleased that we had so many great options to choose from (yay, Kleine Zalze!).  Service was an absolute delight that night and we truly enjoyed our dining experience there, which is saying a lot for a hotel!I also took advantage of the spa on my first night there, having critically injured my pedicure by having a bag dropped on my feet at the Namibian airport.  I scored an appointment in the spa for that same day; the mani/pedi I ordered took 2 delicious hours of relaxing time.  And the mani/pedi looked fab!  Prices were definitely ex pat prices, but the convenience made it worth it - plus I was so relaxed, I actually fell asleep during the service!Speaking of the spa, the rooftop bar is quite lovely and a relaxing spot.  I must note that the lap pool is a lot smaller than I expected and is right in the middle of the roof, so be aware that if you want to swim to work out, anyone in the bar area will be watching you.  Checkout was a BREEZE!  My bill was 100% correct and it was no problem at all to divide out lodging costs from personal costs.  Great job Hilton!So, what could possibly have caused a variable service comment?  Here we go.... On our very first night, the power in my colleague's room went out around 9:00pm, just as she was heading to bed.  She called and found out it was only out in her room and that someone would take care of it.  2 hours later - sitting in the dark in her room - she essentially had to wrangle someone to get them to come up and resolve the power issue.  Note - she hadn't plugged anything so she hadn't tripped a breaker, yet the folks she spoke to made her feel at fault and that they shouldn't help her.  Super duper weird and made for a rough start to her week.I needed to exchange money one day so went to the front desk to change it out.  I was told no money had arrived; come back at 7:00.  I came back at 7:00 and was told no, the money hadn't arrived, check back.  I called down at 8:00 and got a curt reply that no money had come yet.  I called back at 9:00 and was firmly told that no, no money was coming, they only accepted credit cards and didn't keep cash on hand, and no, they couldn't even change $20 (that's all I wanted to change out), all while being very huffy on the line.  Just very rude, and not the customer service I expect from a HIlton.We also had a surly waitress every morning at breakfast.  We'd see her smile at other patrons, but to us, we got snarls.  It actually got comical to see her face change when she would happily look at someone else, and then look at us and frown.  I never quite understood why she was so rude to us, but she definitely was.  Boohoo.Making a spa appointment was confusing - I got told the line was busy and that someone would call me... but after an hour, nothing.  So I called directly and got a booking.  Just no follow-up one would expect from a hotel of this caliber.Other small things:  water bottles were in the room on day 1, but never replaced.  I got stuck on the elevator one morning and rode all the way up when I needed to go down, and then stopped at several floors on the way.  The shape of the sink makes water splash out everywhere, so although the look is aesthetically pleasing, it isn't very functional.All in all, I would recommend staying here for the central location, comfortable rooms, and delicious healthy food.  Just be aware that you won't always get service with a smile....","Date of stay: November 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Business as usual","The Hilton Hotel is conveniently located on the fringes of Windhoek CBD. A full range of facilities, although I did not get an opportunity to enjoy any of them.I enjoyed the piano man that entertains the guests during dinner. Breakfast was decent as can be expected and the rooms are high quality and equipped with all the necessaries. I was a bit annoyed that hand towels were not available in the rooms (and not quite sure if this was an oversight).Wifi is also not included in the rate and you pay for it separately. I would expect more from a 5 star hotel. And I did not see any bell boys to assist with luggage. This didn't bother me because I was traveling light bit if I did have luggage I would be annoyed.But all in all a good experience.","Date of stay: June 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Decent business hotel in Windhoek","The Hilton Windhoek is a reasonably comfortable business hotel. I had a few issues connecting up to the (paid for) wifi, but the staff helped me out. The staff were pleasant, ready to help and polite. The rooms were very clean and spacious and the conference facilities more than adequate. A limited choice in the restaurant, but in the grand scheme of things its a small hotel in a small town and well placed in terms of access to the business community of Windhoek. If I returned to the city, I would stay again.","Date of stay: April 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"ON TOP OF THE WORLD","A fabulous modern hotel near to all the amenities of the City Centre. Welcome was courteous by all the staff making us feel like valued customers of the Hilton group. The room was one of the best we have stayed in - large, airy, clean, comfortable bed and chairs, the shower and the bath are to die for plus the cosmetics are what the label says. High speed Wi-Fi connected seamlessly as did the computers in the Busiess Centre. All requests were responded to in doube quicktime but as is allways the ase in Southern Africa the programs are rubbish. However if you are going to watch TV you will miss the fabulous view and facilities on the roof. This is the place if your budget is 5 star dont look any further.","Date of stay: March 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Smart and comfortable ‚Äì another great stay at the Hilton.","Staying in the Hilton was one of the highlights of my business trip to Windhoek. It is a smart and modern building and top-notch in all aspects. The location couldn‚Äôt be any better, right in the heart of the central city, but not hemmed in by other urban buildings, providing the sense of openness. The views over Windhoek from the very attractive rooftop bar and pool are among the best in the city.My room was outstanding and I can‚Äôt really find anything to be critical of ‚Äì high quality furnishings, great views, effective climate control, spotlessly clean, well-maintained, etc. The open flow between bathroom and bedroom is a nice touch and the shower, with a choice of 2 showerheads, was excellent. The huge flat screen TV had a great range of channels and the room had cable internet (which you have to pay extra for). Wifi is available in all the public areas of the hotel.The rooftop gym was so-so. It has a good range of new high quality cardio machines, however the weights selection is fairly poor ‚Äì essentially a multigym and a light set of dumbbells. It is hoped that they will improve on this facility in the near future. Can‚Äôt complain about the views though! The wood-decked outdoor rooftop pool area is quite attractive but the pool is only about 2m wide ‚Äì good for swimming laps or the quick cool-off plunge. The buffet breakfast was awesome, a great selection of fruit, juices, cold and hot foods - a great way to start the day. I found the service at the hotel to be very good, from reception to the doormen to the cleaners, all very friendly and helpful. The lobby and public areas are all very attractive, comfortable and smartly decorated. The frosted glass elevators were neat.Overall I had a great stay and rate this hotel very highly. I will definitely stay here again on future trips to Windhoek and I recommend it to all other travelers. You can get decent rates on the internet, around $150/night ‚Äì good value.","Date of stay: September 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hotel not up to the mark","Stayed twice in the last 3 weeks in the Hilton. The hotel suppose to be one of the best in town but unfortunately it is not anymore. The best experience we had we with the reception. They are friendly, supportive and try to really help with all kind of topics. The restaurant is the opposite. Breakfast had cold scrambled eggs, black (water) coffee - for the cappuccino you had to pay extra. The only highlight was the fresh juice counter. The gym exists but is not well maintained. Pool was closed for maintenance. While the rooms were clean, they are dated. Overall I will try the Avani Hotel on the other side of the street next time.","Date of stay: August 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Fabulous staff make this hotel really special","The reception area is clean, welcoming and the check in was friendly and efficient. A great start!  My room was a great size; the bed, the space, the bathroom was all great.  It was clean and had good provisions - fridge and good toiletries with bottled water.All the staff from the door staff, to housekeeping, to reception are all friendly and manage that balance of being interested but not in your face.  They are warm and happy to chat but quick to get the message if you don't want a long conversation.The hotel was near shops and some museums so a good location.  Although I was there for work so didn't really go anywhere to be able to comment about how far it was to walk to the museum.","Date of stay: March 2020This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Modern and stylish","Stayed twice on business on two different floors. Check in easy with no issues. Lift and card access need for security to use lifts. Rooms modern and stylish with fresh water provided, quiet AC.  No hotel market but there is a Checkers food store in the Mall 5mins stroll down the road. Breakfast had plenty of options so no issues, Evening meals tended to have out or at the Skybar for a quick meal, the service is a little slow between ordering and receiving however. For business its a good hotel with good services and internet speed.","Date of stay: August 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappointing for a Hilton Hotel","Central location .  Stayed for two nights before starting our tour.  Our room was lovely.Main problem was that when eating at the restaurant, the food took a very long time and no explanation given.  Staff not engaged.  No gluten free food items.  This was disappointing since I had made the request when booked in May. The pool and the sky bar were really good.","Date of stay: December 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A good launch pad","We stayed for 1 night at the start of our Namibia adventure - 2 rooms, 2 couples. The hotel was chosen based on our friends having HH points and my husband & I having used Hilton for business many times.Our expectation was good quality, functional, not 5 star at a fair price. The hotel achieved that. The room was huge, clean and more than we required. Roof top pool, not used, but looked nice. Roof top bar fine & not priced at a premium. We ate out but breakfast was good. No additional charge for drinks?Useful also to be able to park our hire car here.All i would say is that I preferred previously staying in a couple of B&B‚Äôs at the start / end of a holiday, as the corporate nature of a Hilton loses some charm when on holiday. However, absolutely no complaints, clean, safe, friendly & central.","Date of stay: March 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Rooftop bar dissapointing ","Visited the Hilton hotel rooftop bar. Place was pretty full in the late afternoon. One barman and an assistant on duty. Waited about 10 minutes for him to take our order at the bar. Two cocktail s and two G & T's. Said he would bring the drinks to the table. After a 20 minute wait I went to remind him. After another 20 minutes we got up and left. Pathetic.","Date of stay: April 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Seltsam","Das Hilton ist das einzige f√ºnf Sterne Hotel in Namibia. Da stellt sich die Frage, ob man es nach namibianischen oder internationalen Ma√üst√§ben bewerten sollte.Um es kurz zu machen: f√ºr Namibia ist es ein hervorragendes Hotel mit sehr guter Ausstattung. Nach internationalen Ma√üst√§ben ist es nicht wirklich ein F√ºnf Sterne Hotel, daf√ºr ist der Service insgesamt viel zu schlafm√ºtzig. Aktive Ansprache oder unaufgeregte Zuvorkommenheit findet man hier nicht. Wenn man etwas bestellt, zum Beispiel in der Bar, dann kommt es oder nicht, vollst√§ndig oder nicht, irgendwann halt. Wir waren um 11:00 Uhr bereits im Hotel, Das zu diesem Zeitpunkt unsere Suite noch nicht zur Verf√ºgung stand, ist nachvollziehbar. Aber trotz 4 Stunden Vorlauf war sie das auch um 15:00 Uhr nicht. So etwas darf nicht passieren, schon gar nicht, wenn das Hotel nicht ausgebucht ist.Highlight ist aber die Rooftop-Bar, hervorragend geeignet f√ºr den sundowner.","Date of stay: September 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very nice property and kind management","I stayed here one night following an intensive photo tour in Namibia and we arrived much later than expected (about 4 a.m.). The manager was so kind and efficient in re-instating our rooms and providing a rate that reflected the fact we would only be sleeping a few hours before we needed to leave for the airport. The rooms were comfortable and clean and I al the facilities very nice. I was sorry there was no time to use the pool or executive lounge as the they appeared to be well above your average Hilton (I am Diamond with Hilton so stay with them frequently). All around I would highly recommend this Hilton.","Date of stay: June 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Distinctly average with terrible wifi","A hotel that offers so much promise but that fails to deliver on expectation. My stay started badly - I arrived at 16:30 and my room was not even ready for me. I was offered not offered anything other than a seat on which to wait. The rooms are a good standard (when you eventually get in one), but the service is very average - not in the least attentive. If you need to use wifi, do not get your hopes up - the worst I have experienced on my travels around many hotels this year. Checking in and out takes an age as well - I feel for you if you are in a rush. In summary, this is not a hotel I will remember with any fondness.","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Slipping into Africa","I have stayed at this hotel twice since my initial review but the time interval was too short to review the second visit seperately. On the second visit the accommodations were ok but there were decidedly dodgy looking folk hanging about in the lobby and on the mezzanine floor near the bar plus we were bothered by a rather persistant 'lady of the evening' who was not ejected by the staff till we complained most strongly. On this visit there was evidence of further slippage. Internet access did not work when we spent our forst night and still did nto work when we returend after an absence of 2 nights. The service in the mezzanine level bar was very poor. We enetered, were ignored for a while by the staff who were gathered round the end of the bar gossiping. I went up and asked if we could get some drinks and they said yes. Sat down to watch a argumeht betweem them as to who was going to actually work....after that service was good till we moved inside as it was cold, ordered a last round of drinks and waited 20 mins for it not to arrive....The room one of my party was given was a smoking room though my HH Honors says non-smoking and I am not sure what was being smoked in there but the air was unbreathable! When the guest asked for another room she was initially told this was impossible but then another desk staff approached and made the change. The Desk staff seem to face a smile range. As you approach they regard you with sort of disdain till you are a few feet away and then break into a smile - sorry but the damage was done on the approach! The service in the restaurant is great however - very freindly folk and the food is good! But dont ask for a paoched egg for breakfast - cant do it! I think we will try the Kalahari for a while or a Luxury Room at Roof of Africa....Lastly the cleanliness of the room was very poor in the toilet - we arrived quite late at night and did not notice what was on the glass wall till we got up the next morning!","Date of stay: November 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Stayed three times in last 8 days","We stayed here at the Hilton cause it‚Äôs central in the city and you can walk around rather than taking taxis.  The concierge welcome you warmly and took our bags to reception. Check in each time was done quickly.  Staff are friendly and seem to like there job.  We had executive rooms each time but things varied a bit. In the first room there was no room service where there was in the second and third stay.  There was a spa menu in the room however one time they said they were not taking bookings and two times it was kept closed.   The executive lounge is smaller than usual however you are greeted warmly. The meals here we have found the buffet breakfast good. In the evening you can have buffet or a la carte and they have pizza on the menu However every time we were told no they didn‚Äôt light the oven. That‚Äôs fine just don‚Äôt have it on the menu then and you need a few more choices on the a la carte menu in that case. Something upset me the first stay in the meal area so have been careful the last two stays what I eat. There is a sky deck and pool if you are that way inclined. The pool obviously has a problem with the roof of inside the hotel as plaster has come off and has been repainted over.  It‚Äôs not the usual Hilton experience we have had.  The staff though have been very friendly","Date of stay: August 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good stopover in Windhoek","Convenient stop over in the Capital Hilton is a good place for an overnight stay in Windhoek as it is located in the city center in close foot distance to shopping malls and other stores.Lobby/reception - is big and spacious, but at the same it has some cozy seating area with a small stall where you can buy light snacks and drinks. There is also an outside lounge area with access to the casino.Room - standard rooms are decent. It has a relatively big sleeping area and bathroom with both a shower and a tub. However, the bathroom and room cannot be separated except the toilet. The bed is very comfortable. Two waters, small chocolates, tea and coffer was complementary. WIFI - complementary and works perfectly around the property and in the room. Restaurant - we tried the restaurants and they were both really good. The breakfast buffet was though so-so as there are not that much variety of options. You can opt to get the breakfast delivered to your room if you have an early flight, which was a big plus for us.Rooftop - the hotel has a rooftop with a small pool and laying chairs as well as small seating areas. There is also a bar that serves food.SPA - The hotel has, but we did not try.Gym - poor options and only focus on cardio with 5 different machines. Common toilets - outdated and poorly maintained. Could use a refurbishment. But the property is in general very clean and tidy.Casino - have an ok size casino with 5 table options incl. blackjack and roulette as well as lots of slot machines.","Date of stay: March 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Catastrophe : totalement d√©sorganis√© et probl√®me de s√©curit√©, mieux vaut aller au Heinitzburg","Apr√®s un long voyage en avion et un temps infini pass√© √† l'a√©roport en formalit√©s administratives, nous nous r√©jouissions d'arriver dans un h√¥tel moderne et efficace o√π tout fonctionne bien.- cruelle d√©sillusion 1 : le check-in prend 30 minutes, en raison d'un probl√®me dans le syst√®me informatique de l'h√¥tel. La chambre donn√©e ne correspond pas √† notre r√©servation booking (lits jumeaux). Nous demandons une nouvelle chambre et le transfert de nos bagages. Deux heures plus tard, nos bagages ne sont toujours pas l√†. L'organisation semble d√©plorable.- cruelle d√©sillusion 2 : nous commandons un rapide d√Æner au bar de l'h√¥tel en rooftop avec vue sur Windhoek. Nous avons mis 1 heure √† √™tre servis ! Entre temps, la nuit √©tait tomb√©e et il faisait tr√®s froid. Impossible de r√©cup√©rer des v√™tements car nos bagages n'√©taient toujours pas mont√©s dans nos chambres...- cruelle d√©sillusion 3 : le check-out prend encore du temps, parce que l'h√¥tel n'a pas de monnaie sur une somme pourtant ridicule. Franchement...- le wifi est payant, ou gratuit si vous faites partie du programme de fid√©lisation Hilton. Clairement, il s'agit d'une strat√©gie mesquine et malvenue pour contraindre les clients √† se faire spammer par la cha√Æne.- les ascenseurs sont extr√™mement lents, on passe sa vie √† les attendre.- nous avons not√© un √©norme probl√®me de s√©curit√©. A force d'attendre l'ascenseur, nous avons voulu privil√©gier les escaliers. Toutefois, la porte du rez-de-chauss√©e donnant sur le hall ne s'ouvre pas de l'int√©rieur : en cas d'incendie, les clients sont pi√©g√©s (ils doivent remonter au 1er et faire tout un d√©tour). - les toilettes ne ferment que par une porte en verre avec la salle de bain, elle-m√™me compl√®tement ouverte sur la chambre. Bonjour l'intimit√©.Au global, nous avons pr√©f√©r√© de loin l'Hotel Heinitzburg de Windhoek (sauf son restaurant qui nous a d√©plu.Toutefois l'h√¥tel dispose de vrais atouts : - Le petit d√©jeuner est tr√®s complet et plut√¥t bon- Les chambres sont grandes et confortables","Date of stay: August 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice Hotel, But Falls Short of Potential","First, the positives: the hotel has an attractive design and layout with comfortable beds.  The front desk staff was efficient and recognized my Hilton status and upgraded me to an executive room and access to the executive lounge.  The lounge staff was friendly and helpful, and get bonus points for remembering my name the following day!  The view from the sky bar is gorgeous (although the new high rises next door detract from the view), and indeed is a pleasant location for a sundowner.However, the hotel has some notable deficiencies which merit the immediate attention of management.  As noted in other reviews, the hotel's wifi ranged from non-existent to horrible.  This is unacceptable in a business class hotel in a city where 4G LTE service is available.  The apparent lack of urgency in remedying this shortcoming is concerning.  For travelers who depend on connectivity, I recommend you go elsewhere.The lounge, while attractive, offers a minimal (cold) breakfast offering.  The management should consider some modest additions to make it truly an alternative to the main restaurant for its business visitors.I also believe the Hilton Windhoek could provide nicer amenities for its ""executive"" rooms in addition to being on a high floor.  Nescaf√© doesn't cut it in 2017.  Even Keurig would have been a step up from freeze-dried coffee.","Date of stay: March 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Allerdings wird dies durch das regelrecht ignorante, unfreundliche und unaufmerksame Personal wieder zunichte gemacht.

"Comfortable city hotel","We stayed for 1 night on a tour of Namibia. We had a large room with comfortable beds and soft pillows. Toiletries were provided and the shower was good, although some people may not like the open plan bathroom!  A user-friendly safe, tea and coffee making facilities and great breakfast.  A huge variety of cold options plus hot food to order from the open kitchen.  Plenty of friendly and efficient staff - a relaxing first night after a long journey.","Date of stay: July 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comfortable,  great location","Stayed here for 1 night before & after a tour. The hotel is in a great location, walking distance to shops and restaurants. It's about 30 minutes from the airport and the hotel can arrange transport. Nice rooftop bar and pool, and excellent breakfast, including made to order fresh juice. Friendly check in staff. Comfortable beds. The only drawback was the lack a door on the bathroom in atwin share room. While the toilet has a door, the rest of the bathroom is open to the room. As friends sharing for the first time it was a little awkward stripping for a shower with just the frosted shower door to stand behind.  Not an issue for couples in a double room, but a bathroom door would be nice in the twin share rooms for a bit of privacy.","Date of stay: June 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Terrible stay at Hilton","I have visited many hiltons, yet this hotel does not meet the Hilton standard. The check-in procedure was a terrible experience (took 3 hours to get actually a room assigned) with 3 young children waiting (we did arrive after 14h00). Also dinner ordered, not delivered. Taxi booked, did not come. I believe the processes are not under control. Avoid this hotel under all conditions.","Date of stay: January 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very badly managed","We were a party of eight people. One of our rooms (room 112) was only ready at 18h00. The shower drain in our room , 614 was blocked so it flooded the bathroom and carpet when we showered. There was no coffee cups in one of the rooms ( room 117) and it took for ever to get ones in the morning. Dirty towels was left on the bed in one of the rooms ( room 177 ) which was supposed to be ready. Two of the three lifts was broken and we waited a long time for the lifts. So I had to take the stairs from the 6th floor. The only plus point was that the hotel staff is very friendly.","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sch√∂ner Aufenthalt","Wir haben zwei N√§chte dort gewohnt. Das Einchecken war sehr m√ºhsam, da die Zimmerauswahl sehr schwer eine Einigung fand. Auch das inkludierte Fr√ºhst√ºck wurde erst nach l√§ngerer Diskussion erkannt und akzeptiert. Der Zimmerpreis war ebenfalls zuerst inkorrekt zu hoch, wurde dann aber korrigiert. Das Zimmer war qualitativ sehr hochwertig, ruhige Klimaanlage, sch√∂nes Bad mit separater gro√üer Dusche und gutes, breites Bett. Gro√üer K√ºhlschrank und Sitzgelegenheiten komplettieren dies. Das Parken in der Tiefgarage kostet 80 N$ pro Nacht, was sehr g√ºnstig ist. Die Lage ist sehr zentral und man kann zu Fu√ü das Zentrum von Windhoek erkunden. Der Pool auf dem Dach ist gro√ü und hat eine tolle Aussicht, mit Bar dabei und sch√∂nen Sitzgelegenheiten. Fr√ºhst√ºck ist Hilton International gut, es gibt auch Espresso.

"No white wine!?!?","We visited on a Friday night and were looking forward to a lovely evening admiring the views. With it being a Hilton we were expecting it to be a treat. However, upon ordering our first drink - a bottle of wine - we soon realised this would not be the case. They were out of the wine we asked for so we went to look at the menu to pick another bottle only to be told they were completely out of white wine. This was at around 8pm on a Friday night! The waitress then said they had enough wine for 1 glass but that was all they had. When my partner asked for a gin and tonic we were then told there was no tonic water. We were literally speechless! Because we had been looking forward to coming here all day we decided to make the best of it and he had a gin and dry lemon. After deciding to stay for one more drink and asking for a vodka lemonade only to be told there was no lemonade we just decided to leave. After sitting for a while waiting for the bill to be brought over we noticed one of the waitresses waving over at us from the bar. My partner went over to be told the printer wasn't working so he would need to check the bill on the till. I understand these things happen but the waitress was so rude and lazy. She clearly couldn't be bothered coming across to speak to us.We were really disappointed with our visit to the roof top bar. Also the entire time we were there there was a plate of what must have originally been chicken wings sitting on the bar half eaten. No one went near it to remove the plate. Not what you want to see while enjoying a drink. I must also mention the 'dj' who was playing horrendous music. He spend most of the time strutting around speaking to his friends and popping behind the bar. Maybe his wage could go towards the drinks order to ensure you have enough stock for the weekend????","Date of stay: October 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Excellent location to explore Windhoek","We stayed here for one night after doing a Safari and before catching our flight. It is a perfect location for wandering around Windhoek. The room was clean, comfortable and spacious. Breakfast was average and service seems to always be a bit of a challenge but otherwise no complaints. If you're looking for a bite to eat try Caf√© Craft, it's a few minutes walk from the hotel. Also if you're looking for a unique dining experience try Joe's Beerhouse. It's a must. The concierge can help with reservations and transport, it's about 20 mins taxi ride. It is very popular so make sure you book before going.","Date of stay: October 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My first trip to Namibia","I made my way to Windhoek, Namibia recently for a quick business trip. This was my first time to the country and I can't believe it has taken me this long. I stayed at the Hilton Hotel, which is very central to most facilities and amenities in the city.   The hotel staff are extremely friendly, and they go out of their way to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The rooms are clean, extremely comfortable and I had a great view of the city too. It's a wonderful hotel and it comes highly recommended.","Date of stay: July 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great Architecture, Service leaves a lot to be desired","Our first impressions of this hotel were not good, and at the end of day 1 I was ready to cancel our return stay after out safari. No porters to carry our luggage on arrival, 1 hour wait for room service, and a guest services member who never never followed up on our tour booking until asked when we saw her on the lift. The concierge furthered out frustration by ringing  us to tell is our taxi was in reception and then giving it away to another customer, and then re-ordering us. Taxi  which we had to wait 15 mins. More annoying was the claim you always had to wait in Africa.  Having travelled the length and breadth of Africa, he gives the entire continent a bad rep! After  one night I would have rated this hotel 1star. Having said that, service in the restaurant was great, as was that on the roof top bar. Lucas and Lorna in the spa deserve a special mention, as did Patrick from security who manages to get us a  taxi pronto! The hotel is luxurious with great architecture, and a stunning rooftop bar and pool. Great quality linen and luxury fittings are in line with what you would expect from Hilton group. The bathrooms are a little impractical if you are not staying with close family, as they are completely open to the main room. They could also benefit from a night light, but rooms are great overall, as is the gym on the roof.","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"""A Design Flaw""","The staff was wonderful and attentive, the rooms fine (but see below), the location excellent, and the breakfast buffet and other food were quite good. A broken shower head was fixed promptly and effectively by competent staff.  It was unfortunate not to have any hot water three mornings during a week's stay (remedied twice after calling for service, but not the third time).  But most important, if there was any water at all on the stone bathroom floor, it became extremely  slippery.  I felt like a competitor in a new Olympic event, akin to curling, as I pushed a towel ahead of me after each shower, carefully assuring that no inch of the floor was lethally damp.When a staff member asked me how I was enjoying my stay I told him about this ""feature"" of the bathroom floor; he nodded knowingly (indicating he'd heard this before) and said he would report the experience -- but nothing changed.As I checked out after a week and was asked by another staff member, I detailed my slipping and sliding and was told that ""yes, this was a design flaw"" -- one that had been reported before.A ""design flaw"" -- a bathroom floor that must remain completely dry? A design flaw indeed -- one that, despite other winning features in the Hilton Windhoek -- leads me to seek alternatives on future visits to Namibia.","Date of stay: February 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not living up to Hilton standards","While the hotel is clean and the rooms are modern and spacious, the service is poor!! The restaurant was a major let down. I am not going to go into specifics, but would only recommend this hotel as a one night stop over. If I had stayed over more than one night, it would have driven me crazy. Now we are on our way back there on the 3rd of January...I am not getting my hopes up that it will be better. There is a management problem at this hotel. I see you respond to complaints, but it does not seem that you are doing anything to rectify the issues. I can also write responses and make promises. Let's see what happens when we go back.

"Not very enjoyable","This hotel was booked and paid for as we were looking forward to a little luxury before heading out on an African Safari.  After missing a flight due to inclement weather - the Hilton was contacted advising that we wouldn't be arriving until early next morning, therefore, not sleeping, but just using our paid room for freshening up, eating breakfast before heading on safari. On arrival, we were advised that we were put in as a ""no show"" and wouldn't be able to access our room. As we had friends staying (who were waiting for our arrival) we then headed off to get breakfast, but had to pay for that (even though it was included in our room rate, that we didn't get to use). Sorry but I wouldn't be recommending this accommodation to anybody.","Date of stay: September 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Slipping badly","This is the second time I have stayed in the hotel in the past 6 months and the standard has dropped. During this visit the complementary water in the room was discontinued without explanation. This is the first 4/5 star hotel I have stayed in over 29 countries that this has happened and is an obvious but petty cost saving device. I had problems with my final account and was subjected to a ""take it or leave it"" approach by the duty manager who obviously needs an interpersonal skills course.

"Hilton Hotel Windhoek, Namibia","Very nice hotel and good location.  This was our first trip to Windhoek, so wasn't sure what to expect.  Breakfast buffet is good and the roof top bar is fun. Hotel offers airport pick up and drop off for an additional charge, but worth it.  Be sure if you are booking a transfer to let them know if it is the international airport as this is considerably further than the domestic airport.

"Much Potential","I am torn between a 5 star and 3 star review.  I guess, I could have went with a 4 star but one particular incident (which turned out okay) could have been a mess.  The Windhoek Hilton is very cool; modern and not tacky.  The lobby is bright with lots of clever little touches and well staffed.  Well staffed, as in plenty of people to help you out.  All the staff were quite friendly and seemed to know what their own jobs were - general things and requests outside their own description seems to bring a little confusion though.  I don't mean, requesting the elevator guy to give you a pedicure, but asking the person who clears the dishes for coffee was ineffective.  That said, I find that happens quite a bit in Africa.  (I'm a Canadian/American living in Botswana)The rooms were great.  Large, inviting, and CLEAN!  For me, ""clean"" is the most important hotel adjective, and our rooms were spotless.  Open concept with a separate toilet area, plenty of water pressure, big towels, and lots of amenities in case you forgot something.  (razors, shaving cream, toothbrush, shoe mitt, etc. . . .  My wife thought the lotion was pleasant smelling for what it's worth.Food was good in the restaurant and our caipirinhia at the roof-top pool bar was perfect.  (We have had some really bad drinks in Africa so this was a welcome treat.) Okay, so why the 3 star review?  Well, for starters, check-in was ridiculous.  It was not busy at all yet took forever.  Our reservation had been canceled for starters, and no one could explain why.  I asked if they had rooms available, which they did, so I told them ""no big deal"" let's just check into some rooms they had available.  There was lots of running around, and discussion, and running around, etc. . . After 15 minutes we were offered a seat and a drink which we declined and waited another ~10 minutes before finally receiving our rooms.  I still am not sure what was happening.  Just put your guests in a room, and figure out any problems you might be having afterward.  (we had just driven up from Swakop and wanted to settle in and grab some lunch.)Lunch was good enough, and guests ate for 130 bucks/buffet.  We live in reasonably rural Bots and wanted to hit a mall, so down to get the car.  They had parked it for me at check-in and handed me a ticket.  We had no idea where it was though (I thought they were valet parking for me)  They pointed out where the garage elevator was and down we go to the upper garage.  Apparently, the upper garage is more love-nest than garage, as it was empty except for 2 amorous couples who appeared to be returning from a rendezvous - glad we weren't a couple minutes earlier. They directed us to the Lower Garage where we found our car. (the seats were not reclined so I took that as a good sign)  The ticket we received would not let us out though the gate though.  Time elapsed, add more money or something.  We backed up and found someone to release us back into the wilds of Windhoek, and were off.Okay, the biggest problem was on our check-out day.  We were traveling with my parents who are pretty well-traveled - and I should add that they liked the hotel on the whole, and they're used to the Ritz/Mombo/and other 5 star fare.  We kept having staff visit us before checking out.  I think the housekeepers stopped by around 9:00AM - whatever, we told them we'd be checking out at 11:00AM. (Check out is noon)  Then someone came by who wanted to check out mini-bar.  Dude, leave us alone, come count when we're gone.  It was the non-staff visitor that was disturbing.  My parents were hanging out in their room and some dude in a military uniform just walks in.  He was pulling a suitcase, so I assume he was trying to check into his room - but this should not happen.  Things happen in hotel rooms that should not be disturbed - not in my parents' room I hope, but in other rooms.  Or who knows, what if nobody was there and the entrant was a thief?  What if my wife was alone and the person was unsavory?  She might kick his a@@, but. . . I hope this is a rare event.  I realize that this could happen anywhere, but it should not.  The staff appeared to be earnest and trying - they were friendly, but it seems like they need a layer of training on becoming capable on general help outside their exact job description.  (I didn't mention the hot coffee at breakfast we requested didn't come until we were finishing up our breakfast - that was a long 3 minutes!)  Great hotel, friendly staff, a little too rough around the edges (staff doesn't really seem to understand what a typical guest is looking for - assuming I know what a typical guest is looking for) - and they need to seriously work on their check-in/check-out procedures.","Date of stay: April 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Stay away","This was my second stay at the hotel the first one was uneventful, it seemed like a nice enough place but the first day was only about four or five days. On this last trip we were there for more than two weeks.   I had to change rooms because one room had no air conditioning, and when I got up in the morning to wash my face there was no water coming out of the faucet in the bathroom. So I get moved to another room, this time there‚Äôs no heat! Yes I said heat because it did get rather cool. Also both rooms were an electrical safety issue hazard, if you look at the light on the side of the bed where the switches to turn it on and off the wires are exposed in both of the rooms I was in because they didn‚Äôt have anyone who knew what they were doing put the switches in place probably to save money.  The next thing if you let the water run either the cold or the hot and put it in a clear glass and stir it look at all the yummy stuff floating around in the water!  The staff tries to do what they can but the reality is management is literally out to lunch, all they wanna do is to collect the money there is no upkeep to the property and there‚Äôs no training in food handling for the kitchen staff. You would see people rubbing their crotch or sticking their finger up their nose while they‚Äôre doing food prep we brought it to the attention of the chef but he can‚Äôt watch the people all the time.  All the beds and the linen need to be replaced the beds are very uncomfortable. And now for the highlight of my trip my colleague got food poisoning twice eating breakfast at the hotel, I got food poisoning 3√ó1 time which is literally incapacitated me. All within the first week I got sick I would not eat breakfast which was included in my room, there was a nice German restaurant about a 5 to 8 minute walk away which I had all my meals.   Management has mastered the art of being reactive making lots of promises but delivering on nothing, yes-man is the term. I‚Äôm sorry but Hilton is a brand-name in this property should not be licensed to operate under the Hilton franchise. If anyone from Hilton reads this I have pictures to back me up on the electrical hazard presented by the lamp in both rooms. Seems to me that both of the brand name hotels in Windhoek are pathetic as a Protea is just as bad as the Hilton.","Date of stay: July 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great stay in Windhoek","We had to separate stays at the Windhoek Hilton on either side of our safari in Namibia. Our first room was an Executive King room. It was fine for one day, but the bathroom area was quite small.Our second room was the Diplomatic suite. This was very spacious. It had two large bathrooms complete with showers and toilets and a very large sitting area. Happy hour is from 6-8pm. You can order drinks, snacks and dinner. Both rooms had Executive lounge access. The normal Exeuctive lounge is closed for COVID, but they‚Äôve cordoned off a private area in the main restaurant for Executive lounge guests.    The staff are very friendly and helpful. Claudia at the front desk and Jacob, one of the managers, were especially good.The hotel helped us arrange COVID tests. We visited the DiagnoLab. They offer 6-hour, 12-hour and 24-hour turnarounds at different price points. The hotel is clean and well functioning. We would recommend it for a stay in Windhoek.","Date of stay: April 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sehr gutes Hotel - Inkompetente Rezeptionisten","Wir haben insgesamt drei N√§chte im Hilton Windhoek √ºbernachtet und k√∂nnen hinsichtlich der zentralen Lage, der sch√∂nen Zimmer, der Dachterrasse samt Pool und der Speisenqualit√§t nur Positives berichten. Leider ist jedoch das Personal an der Rezeption von einfachsten Dingen √ºberfordert.1. Die von uns vorgebuchte erste √úbernachtung am 18.12.19 wurde, wie ich zu Hause nach Durchsicht meiner Kontoausz√ºge feststellen mussten, meiner Kreditkarte dreimal belastet. Bisher ist trotz mehrfacher emails keine Korrektur erfolgt. 2. Vor unserer Heimreise √ºbernachteten wir erneut im Hilton. Wir buchten zuerst nur f√ºr eine Nacht und erhielten den besten verf√ºgbaren Preis. Als wir etliche Stunden sp√§ter noch eine weitere Nacht hinzubuchten, wurde uns ein wesentlich h√∂herer Preis genannt. Auf unsere Nachfrage hin mussten wir miterleben, wie eine erfahrene Kollegin der anderen erkl√§rte, wie man den besten verf√ºgbaren Preis f√ºr einen Gast im System findet, den wir dann  auch anstandslos erhielten.3. Wir hatten um einen Weckruf f√ºr 5 Uhr morgens gebeten, der nicht erfolgte.4. Beim Auschecken wurde ein Fehler bei der Rechnungsstellung f√ºr diese beiden N√§chte festgestellt, der erst nach 10 Minuten durch Einschalten eines weiteren Mitarbeiters behoben werden konnte. Als Entsch√§digung mussten wir die Parkgeb√ºhren nicht bezahlen. 5. Die Hilton Bonuspunkte sind uns bislang nur f√ºr 2 N√§chte gut geschrieben worden.","Date of stay: December 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Exploiting the customers due to their monopoly in Windhoek","The desired rooms were not made available. Check in and check out experience was terrible each taking more than 45  min. The hotel doesn't have a conceirge to keep luggage. The room service,  restaurant and breakfast food options are limited. The quality of food for the price is extremely sub standard. Despite of being a loyal member and making many requests for lounge access, late check-out etc. were not honoured. Please don't stay here and try other options. Though not 5 star but are good hotels.","Date of stay: November 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Goto Hilton","Goto HiltonThe Hilton is a great place to hang out and among the locals seems to be a place to go for its rooftop pool & bar.Positives+ on-site parking+ there is an outdoor parking area next door where local people sell traditional handmade items; great place to get some local shopping and support the economy (the Namib economy has not been good for everyone)+ lounge staff is very helpful+ big roomsNegatives- A young man running the check-in, and temperamental by nature and possibly a manager or supervisor, and of Afrikaans or of German descent, would yell at the local staff for ridiculous things which reflected poorly on hotel management. He seemed to be under a lot of stress, but considering he is in the hospitality industry, he should know how to conduct himself. Also, as a very young person, surprising to see him ‚Äúsupervising‚Äù when there were many more well-behaved local staff who could probably have done what he was doing better. The Hilton was the only place where we saw non-locals supervising- Rooms are dirty and not well cleaned (nor maintained)- Not able to provide breakfast for early morning starts- This section of town is not good, particularly after-hours","Date of stay: December 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good stay","Located in central Windhoek, close to shops and restaurants and the few (German) sights. Car parking was NAD 60 per night. Big room, comfy beds, quiet, good airco, fridge, tv, safe and a partial see-through bathroom. Lunch and dinner at the roof skybar (where the pool is too) offers great views although almost no areas with shade (it gets really hot!). The food is really good at the skybar but more expensive than the local restaurants. Also, there is no kids menu at the skybar or the other restaurant although there is a kids menu in the room service; that doesn't make any sense. Breakfast experience was mixed; on our first morning there was not enough food, items were missing and not refilled, and bread was old; on our second morning (at the same time) there was plenty of food and all was fresh.","Date of stay: July 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Corporate Hotel with a fantastic roof terrace","Stayed here for one night in April - standard corporate decor and feel to the hotel, breakfast was good and service was very good. The location is convenient to most attractions although taxi is the recommended method of travel, especially at night, so location is not particularly important in Windhoek. The stand out feature was the rooftop terrace which afforded fantastic views over the city. It was a popular spot and we grabbed the last available seats (on a Thursday night) for a pre-dinner drink to watch the sunset.","Date of stay: April 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Food served buffet style for the group for breakfast (open to all guests) with eggs to order andand to group in meeting room.

"an unexpected delight","Ok it is a Hilton but the level of service the staff and comfort were outstanding even for Hilton. Immaculately clean and well taken care of property. The staff are extremely attentive without being a pain in the butt. The rooms are nice sized the beds are comfy. Its smack in the middle of downtown so you are right there for shopping and restaurants. The breakfast bar is perfect its not so large as to be overwhelming but everything there is tasty and cooked correctly. The exec lounge upstairs again is not whelming but there is always two main courses and two sides and they taste good. WiFi is spot on and works well in the room. I stayed here for 10 days was never unhappy...This is the place to stay if you are in Windhoek","Date of stay: May 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Excellent Service, Great Location","My 7 year old daughter and I stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our 11 night visit to Namibia. Windhoek doesn‚Äôt have much touristy to write home about, but the Hilton gives you a comfortable and central location to explore the capital while preparing to head further afield. The craft market is right next door, supermarket across the street, and a Hertz car rental office is located in the lobby. A short walking tour of the main sights - the church, the independence museum, the Kudu statue - can easily be done from the Hilton. The staff were extremely helpful. When I needed to buy outlet adaptors the staff volunteered to do it for me. We ordered room service and were very pleased with the food quality and the service. Breakfast is quite good - smaller than I expected when I first walked in, though the breakfast room is deigned very nice - but we had plenty to eat. I especially liked the made on the spot fruit smoothies.","Date of stay: April 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Amazing location excellent service and lovely food","Staying here for few days before flying home.The rooms are very comfortable with all modern amenities.The best thing here is the staff.Friendly and extremely professional. For a big hotel chain they are very attentive and admirable in the way they carry out their job.The hotel is 6 mins walk from the Nambian Craft centre where many items can be purchased at reasonable prices after little bargaining. The Ekipa restaurant in the hotel does an ala carte menu at a reasonable price. There is also a buffet for NAD265.This is lot cheaper than other hotels in Etosha and elsewhere. The staff are lovely and Anna particularly was excellent in serving in Ekipa restaurant.I was impressed with the size of the rooms which are big. They are extremely clean and very comfortable. So relaxing being here.","Date of stay: December 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Cosy & Modern Hilton Windhoek","We chose the Hilton Windhoek, looking for some creature comforts after arriving into Namibia well after 24 hours of travel time. The hotel is walking distance to the malls. The building is modern with very friendly front desk staff that were friendly and efficient.Our request for a room with a good view was accommodated and we got room 608 which had a nice overall view.The room was of good size and very comfortable with a open concept bathroom with private shower enclosure, WC and a soaking bathtub. Great amenities too.We were expecting bathrobes, but a simple call to housekeeping to request for them had two bathrobes sent up in no time.Two minor grouses to our room:The shower enclosure door did not shut well leaving a slight gap that allowed water to flow out keeping what should be the dry area, wet.Mould trapped in between the silicone and the four sides of the shower stall floor could be easily removed by scraping and removing the old silicone, and resealing the corners again with fresh clean silicone. For some reason the soaking bathtub had better water pressure too.The sky bar was refreshing and a nice place to unwind after a long day.Breakfast was simply wonderful. Quality over quantity, with fresh juices and just a wonderful selection of quality breakfast staple food. Very happy to note the use of biodegradable straws in the restaurant. None of those awful plastic straws that destroy our enviroment. Good thinking Hilton Windhoek!Look out for 'Miss Breakfast' who might come round to interact and enquire on your stay. A fine example of good hospitality.Great internet connection thru out the hotel and not just in the lobby area's (most hotels in Namibia only provide internet in the common areas)Overall a welcome stay after what seemed to be an eternity of traveling time.","Date of stay: November 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Dissappointed with room detail","A recent one night stay. The room was a good size however it felt very dark and depressing. There had been some renovations but the side tables had the handles broken or hanging off and the drawers in poor order. A bit more attention to detail on the shower edges was also needed. On a positive the dinner menu (not the buffet) was very nice and varied. Breakfast buffet was average and obviously the staff do not like the early start as their faces showed how much they did not wish to be there.","Date of stay: July 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The usual, high, Hilton standard","The Windhoek Hilton was a nice end to a two-week self-drive visit to Namibia: the usual superb bathroom suite with well-designed lighting, nice-sized room with all facilities was very welcome. The room furniture and carpet were, however showing their age, and was a little shabby.I had the most incredible ""above-and-beyond"" helpful assistance from the young concierge on duty when I arrived! He quickly got a taxi and then escorted me to several nearby bookshops to search for books on Namibian wild flowers, before the bookshops closed; he then printed my boarding passes for my flights. I am most grateful.","Date of stay: June 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great place to stay","We stayed our first night in Namibia here and had a very good experience. Staff were friendly and helpful. The room was large (two double beds) and comfortable with good amenities. The only reason I didn't give it the full five stars is that the bathroom gives very little privacy. There is no door between the shower area and the rest of the room, which is awkward if you are traveling with your kid or a friend! The breakfast buffet was really good and staff came by often to check on our meal. The breads were especially good. Free standard wifi was available to HiltonHonors members.This seems like a new property, and it was in very good condition.

"Full service, comfortable and helpful staff","First impression of the lobby area is not luxurious.  However the restaurants and rooftop bar are quite nice and the food is good.  The room was large, with good lighting, and a large open bathroom with nice fixtures and closed toilet room.  AC worked well.  Bed firm but comfortable with nice linens.  No bathrobe, but nice towels.  Medium sized TV with decent channels.  Desk and chair very good, with European and UK outlets provided.  Breakfast was normal selection, with a good variety and everything seemed fresh. Closet, safe and toiletries all fine.  Coffee service all instant but plenty of it.  The pool is very small, but the deck is nice.  Fitness room small, with about 6 machines.Cons:  the wifi is not free unless you are an Honors member, and even then I was only able to connect one device and had to renew each day.  Also, the signal was weak.  There is a fridge but it was empty - no minibar, if you are counting on a nice cold beer while you unpack you are out of luck. Only one small bottle of water was provided - I had to buy extra at the coffee bar downstairs.","Date of stay: January 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great views from top floor bar/dining","Only stayed one night with my husband.  Modern hotel, well situated in city centre. Good selection of restaurants and bars in the hotel.  The Ekipa restaurant had an extensive buffet incorporating many Namibian specialities as well as the a la carte menu.  We loved our Kingklip Thermadore. Excellent, spacious rooms well-equipped with facilities including tea/coffee, ironing board, hairdryer, bath and shower - all as you might expect from a Hilton hotel. There is a small health spa and a small gym. I had a back massage in the former which was good although the walls are thin and it was hard to relax with loud music booming through from the sky bar next door conflicting with my soothing spa music.Top floor pool can get a bit busy especially with the gym, the spa, the sky bar and the views all confined to the same small space.  Great cocktails though!  And although we didn't use it, there's a casino in-house too.Charming, pleasant staff throughout. Would recommend.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good stopover for a wider Namibia trip","Good modern hotel. Easy to find driving from the airport. Parking is in a secure basement car park, $60 for overnight for hotel guests.Diamond members get treated well. Free room upgrade, and also access to executive lounge. A limited hot food dinner and lots of cakes and snacks in the lounge. Free buffet breakfast too for Diamond members.Buffet breakfast was OK, nothing special, typical 4 star hotel standard.Rooms were as expected 4 star standard. Beds super comfy. Air-conditioning worked well. Wifi was strong and worked well. Shower was powerful with good hot water. Only downside is that the bathroom is open plan to the bedroom, so not ideal if sharing a room with someone you're not intimate with.There's a small pool on the roof, and a rooftop bar/bistro with a pretty good view that is worth checking out. Very busy with both guests and locals, seems to be a trendy place to be seen in Windhoek.","Date of stay: September 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A pleasant stay...","I stayed at the Hilton Windhoek with an American friend of mine for a couple of weeks. We both moved rooms a couple of times due to the high occupancy rate at the hotel and our indecisiveness as far as our intended departure date was concerned. The executive floor was convenient (lounge access, extra amenities etc.) even though we spent more time at the Kalabar than anywhere else on the premises. I also had a standard room and a garden room during our stay. My friend opted for a diplomatic suite. The rooms were clean and the staff very friendly. The wifi network's bandwidth/cost is a bit of a bother, but typical for large chain hotels worldwide. Overall, I highly recommend the Hilton Windhoek when visiting Namibia.","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton is not suitable for families","The hotel and rooms are clean and equipped - yet - Hilton. Comfortable bedding and large comfortable beds. The staff was very unkind. Was not attentive to our requests to adapt the rooms to families. The showers are open to rooms without doors. A fact that becomes problematic when staying with teenagers.","Date of stay: July 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great stay and close to CBD","I stay here every time I visit Windhoek. I only come once a year. So I can see if the place has improved or not. The staff friendliness and helpfulness has certainly improved. It is at a high standard. Great decor, comfortable environment for business meetings or just to relax after a long day. It is also close to our company building, mall and various heritage sites and government buildings. All depends why you are in Windhoek. Breakfast is great and room service is great. I can recommend the Pork Belly main and the Chocolate Walnut desert. And I don't even normally like desert.","Date of stay: June 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Mixed feelings- Hilton/Windhoek","I had a truncated stay at this property late April 2017.After my stay at Hilton Sandton in Joburg  I must say Hilton Windhoek has some catching up to do. The mattresses were very uncomfortable and so I did not rest well. Wi Fi was spotty to say the least. On arrival on my second stay, the room had no lights. The winner at this hotel is the very helpful staff. Gabriel , Daphne and others were very kind and welcoming. The meals were good and enough. Hope to see much improvement on my next stay as Windhoek is growing and I'll be back !!","Date of stay: April 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The place to stay in Windhoek","This Hotel is one of the better hotels that I have stayed in on my travels. The staff are welcoming and friendly and the hotel is very modern and well laid out.On Arrival the check in was friendly and efficient. My room was very comfortable and spacious for a standard room. The bathroom had both a nice big bath and a very nice shower.Every night was a different theme in the restaurant and there was a choice of either a buffet or A la Carte. The quality of the food was great and the restaurant staff were very attentive to our needs etc.Breakfast was also great and I especially enjoyed the freshly squeezed fruit juices.The Skybar on the roof was a nice place to relax after work.The only complaint I had was that both treadmills in their gym were not functioning correctly and the gym is a bit small.Value for Money, well in this day and age I suppose you pay for this quality and comfort.","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Inefficiency Service or Fraud attempt","As I speakmy bank account is in short of N$2000.  disappeared during checkin/checkout exercise at reception between a girl and a certain John Farmer. Should Hilton Windhoek really concerned how customers are grieved by staff members, the management would made available immediately after any adverse event. They must be ready to rectify the errors swiftly and amicably. A formal or non-formal apology can heal big wounds inflicted to any person of any colour or age. re. The treatment I got at Hilton this week was pathetic, inhuman, dishonest and possible fraudulent.","Date of stay: April 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Mala acogida","Mala experiencia. Pese a ser un Hilton, al llegar no encontraban nuestra reserva, la piscina estaba inaccesible por mantenimiento, al pedir la cena a la habitaci√≥n no nos permitieron pagar con tarjeta directamente y luego, en el check out, no lo ten√≠an actualizado. Adem√°s, para tener wifi en la habitaci√≥n, hab√≠a que pagar un extra. Demasiado pretencioso y orientado a hotel de negocios para lo que es Namibia.

"One of the best in Windhoek","I use this hotel as my default accommodation in Windhoek. I was one of the very first guest to stay in the hotel and return regularly as I do business in Namibia. I find the accommodation really good with generous sized rooms. The food is good with a great breakfast spread, important if you are like me and have bad eating habits, at least I know I will get one good meal a day. Great bar, good view and restaurants on site.The telephone and internet charges are insanely high. I get around this by purchasing a local SIM when I am in Namibia and I get free WiFi access because I am on the Hilton loyalty program. Take this tip and join the Hilton Honors loyalty program when you check in.The maintenance is not up to scratch and some basic things like the showers that wet the floors, the towels are becoming tatty, etc. makes one wonder where else are they cutting corners. Finally the reception staff are not as responsive as I expect at times but overall compared to the rest of Namibia it is pretty good service.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not authentically Namibian, but a lovely hotel!","We started our trip here and it was the perfect treat before grabbing our 4x4 and heading into the dessert. Not typically Namibian (high rise, a pool, etc.) but nice if you're looking for your 'western comforts'. The bar on the roof next to the pool gives excellent city views and the restaurant had a brilliant selection of cuisine with excellent service. I'd probably stay in a BnB next time, but I cannot fault the hotel itself.","Date of stay: March 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Annemarie Dunn","We stayed for a week at the Hilton Hotel.  I really loved our stay. The room was spacious and lovely with a view of the city. We upgraded to a deluxe room after we went to view it. Little bit more space and a free standing bath. My absolute favorite in the room was the chair, that you can just sink into and relax after a long day out. The bed is King size. The pool area at Sky bar is very relaxing and trendy furniture. Beautiful views over the city from there. The breakfast was the best we had in the whole of Namibia! Crispy Croissants, proper scramble egg.. proper juice that is freshly squeezed .. the only let down is the reception. They need more training. Housekeeping also not very good . They put one chocolate ball on the bed and we two people in the room. This went on for three days.They need training on how to do a Proper turn down..For a 5 star Hotel , they need to work on the English language , they tend to want to speak Afrikaans too much. Waiters at restaurant don't listen carefully to your request. They need to make sure everything on table is functional before service. The salt grinders lid fell of when I was trying to put salt over my food. I had to discard my food! Secondly the Spa didn't motivate me to go for a massage , I just did my nails. They didn't come across as very well trained. My nails started tearing three days after from chemical soaking off.. other than that it's a really great place to stay, apart from small things that can be rectified ..I would definitely let my husband book there again. They must just get proper Spa Therapists there also..","Date of stay: November 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

They serve Bloody Marys but they have no Tabasco or Worcester sauce, half of the ingredients for the drinks not available (they use lemons instead of limes), no pizza because the pizza oven is broken... the list goes on..So disappointed!

Edificio alto, c√©ntrico, impersonal con todo tipo de servicios: gimnasio (sin monitor, solo hay un trabajador viendo la tele que ni sabe ni te explica el funcionamiento de los aparatos; abierto 24h; dispone de agua y vasos asi como de toallas; para abrir la puerta hay que conectar la llave electronica de la habitacion y por algun fallo cada vez que la acercas suelta una descarga-eso si, para evitar grandes da√±os la manilla est√° aislada con un papel de celof√°n-); piscina peque√±a pero suficiente al aire libre y con vistas increibles a la ciudad; sky bar..de lo mejor-por no decir lo mejor- de la ciudad; habitaciomes grandes, limpias con todo lo necesario para estar c√≥modo. Lo malo: wifi de pago, el agua sale por fuera de la ducha, personal lento en todas partes: recepcion, restaurantes...no hay mapas ni te saben explicar nada de ubicaciones.Lo recomiendo si buscas un hotel, sino es preferible una guest house en zonas mas agradables y visitar su sky bar si cuadra.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"An oasis of luxury after dusty travel","My daughter and I ended up with a spare night in Windhoek, so we decided to stay at the Hilton, a relatively new hotel. The room was lovely, comfortable, beautifully appointed. The location can't be beat. We shopped, returned to our room to drop off our things, then went out again. Didn't have to worry about parking, etc. Dinner there happened to be ""Italian night"" and was fine. The gift shop had some unusual jewelry that we bought. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would return.","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good location, terrible amenities","We arrived at Hilton same day as the Indian president delegation. Hotel was full of security checks, police officers and security guards. We booked a room for 2 adults and 1 child but the room was made only for the adults. We had to call reception for an extra bed and the room got very tiny for 2 beds. We had problem with the air conditioner and we had to call 5-6 times for them to solve the problem. Also wifi is only free for HHonors members and connection is terrible. I also had to call for support a couple of times until they fixed the problem. Breakfast was good but the service is very slow. We tried to have the dinner buffet and it took forever to have a waiter to come to our table and take the drinks order and explain the buffet prices and food. Italian night is terrible, I've never seen such Carbonara pasta, may be a Namibian Carbonara. Rooftop swimming pool and bar are really nice !

After 2x2week stays (Feb 2016 and April 2016) the only consistency is: 1. internet that doesn't work in executive level rooms. 2. Lifts that don't work consistently. 3. Laundry that is returned after you have bedded down (2200hrs) 4. Conferencing staff knock-off at 1500 on a Friday and there is no service over the weekend! 5.

Die im Haus angeschlossene Autovermietung ist allerdings der Horror: Auch dort brauchten wir eine Stunde, obwohl wir vorher reserviert hatten. Das war jedoch nicht schlimm, weil das Auto war eh zwei Stunden zu sp√§t, Navi ohne Halterung und nur schlechte Wegempfehlungen (ohne Karte w√§ren wir verloren gewesen).Das Hotel ist jedoch super! Der Preis war super, das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist sehr gro√ü, man hat eine gute Auswahl und kann sich Sachen, wie Saft und Omlett frisch zubereiten lassen. Also kann man sich ruhig viel Zeit daf√ºr nehmen. Die Roof-Top Bar sollte man gerne mal f√ºr ein Bier besuchen. Das Fitnesstudio ist klein, aber hat alles was man braucht.

"Perfect","From check in to resolution of internet connectivity, this hotel is perfect. Staff are courteous and somehow even remember your name as walk past the front desk. Food was good, wide variety of choice and places/restaurants to eat within the hotel. Did not get a chance to try the spa as it was fully booked so review does not include that facility.You won't be disappointed if you choose to stay here.","Date of stay: December 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Windhoek Hilton","I finally got to stay at the The Hilton in Windhoek. My first time visit was an awesome experience. From the entrance till the reception, the peolpe are very kind and the service is remarkably efficient. Special thanks to Anna Asser who made me feel right at home the minute I walked in. What a professional attitude!I love a good breakfast and a dinner buffet, and this hotel has got it all. What a treat!!The rooms are very modern and impeccable. It is very rate in Africa to stay in rooms of this standard and at a reasonable rate. Hilton Windhoek, definitely need (must) to check it out.","Date of stay: November 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great hotel and amazing staff","This a clean, modern hotel. What really makes it is the staff. Amazing, kind, compassionate and extremely helpful. Come to think of it though, that is just the people of Namibia.This hotel treats Hilton Honors status guests very well. The rooftop bar and pool is a great spot to watch the sunset and the executive lounge while a little small is a great place to unwind.","Date of stay: June 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great Value and Location","We started and ended our Namibia self drive tour at the Hilton.  I have never been a fan of the large corporate hotels, but the management of this hotel has changed my mind.  From the warm welcome to the outstanding breakfast, this hotel tries to make you feel comfortable.  We cannot say enough about Vivian Tjombonde in the executive lounge.  Upon arrival he went out of his way to answer any of our questions and to make us feel welcome.  Rooms are well appointed with all the adequate amenities.  We chose this hotel originally because of its central location but it is always the extra steps that people take that can make your trip special.  Hilton did this so why stay anywhere else?","Date of stay: June 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"BAD SERVICE AND EXPERIENCE","Don't accept a room anywhere on the 1st floor, because the disco noice from the basement will make it impossible to sleep, except if one uses medication. Do not expect bottled water in the room unless you call housekeeping to provide it and they might not even give you a choice between still or sparkling.","Date of stay: June 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great stay at Hilton Windhoek!","Just completed a 4 month stay at the Hilton Windhoek.  This is one of the best properties in town in Windhoek. The staff at the hotel go above and beyond to meet your needs.  As a Diamond Hilton Honors member, I have stayed at many properties across the US and abroad, and the executive lounge here is the best that I have experienced. Hats off to Vivian and Gabriel for the personalized attention to each guest in the lounge. Little things like remembering your preferred drink and type of water are greatly appreciated.  I would also like to mention the front desk staff, particularly Elize, Herman, and Christian, for their attention to the many extensions of my stay and excellent customer service.  As a long term guest, the staff at this property really make you feel like a part of the Hilton family. A special thanks is also extended to Chef Emmanuel for his personalized attention to my meals, the 8th floor housekeeping staff (Rakela) and to the amazing porters (Vivian, Gabriel, Fernando, Elvis, and Max) at this property. Job well gone! My only recommendation for improvement is to offer upgrades to your Diamond HHonors members!Dr. Swayzer","Date of stay: April 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sehr gute Unterkunft nach der Ankunft","Das Hilten besuchten wir nach der Ankunft in Windhoek, der Empfang war sehr freundlich und der Check in ging sehr schnell. Das Zimmer war sehr sch√∂n und gro√ü. Das Bad ist ein wahrer Traum. Es sind auch Steckdosen f√ºr deutschen Standard vorhanden. Im  Ein TV gibt es auch ARD und ZDF. Ein Tipp f√ºr Raucher im 4. OG gibt es auch Raucherzimmer. Im Zimmer war nach Ankunft ein Teller mit Pralinen vorhanden. Der W-Lan ist im Lobbybereich frei, an der Rezeption kann man sich einen Code f√ºr den Wifi geben lassen der nach dem login f√ºr 8 Stunden g√ºltig ist. Mit dem Wifi geht auch Skype, auch in der Skybar ist dann W-Lan m√∂glich  so das man am Pool den W-Lan nutzen kann. Der Pool ist mit herrlichem Ausblick √ºber die Stadt auf der Dachterrasse, im Bereich der Skybar. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck l√§st wirklich keine W√ºnsche offen. Alles vorhanden. Besonders lecker fand ich das Omelett. Kalte und Warme speisen, frische S√§fte und Smoothies. Wenn mal etwas fehlen sollte wir dies von der Rezeption sofort erledigt. Vorallem die Lage des Hotels √ºberzeugt, man kann die Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten von Windhoek in kurzer Zeit zu Fu√ü erreichen.Immer gerne wieder.

"Not recommended for a Sleeping Beauty- but staff do try.","Despite being on a high floor, the windows of the hotel do not give 100% protection from construction work noise in the vicinity or any parties from the Sky Bar.  I had to make several phone calls to the duty manager until the DJ in revolt switched off the music 30 minutes late. Food in restaurant at dinner was okay but not breathtaking. Executive Lounge was not what I have experienced in other hotels and the food & beverage quality/quantity needs to be improved. The staff go out of their way to try and resolve things, including the lounge host and duty manager, and reflect the friendliness of Namibia. The concierge staff do need training on what to do around - they were not up to Clefs d'Ors standard. Return to Namibia- definitely. To Hilton Windhoek- possibly.","Date of stay: September 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Dissapointing for the Hilton","Cold showers, cold food, slow elevators, and lacklustre service made for a surprisingly average stay in what is normally a hotel you can expect high standards. It could be as the hotel is still relatively new there are still some teething problems, so let's hope these get ironed out. The small pool on the roof is ok for cooling down but not so good for laps, especially as the bottoms and sides are painted all white so be careful not to bang your head! 24 hour gym is a good addition though.","Date of stay: May 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"For a major flag hotel in nation's capital a little short of topnoch","I have no comparisons in Windhoek but spent three nights in Hilton recently for conference.  Rooms were nice and clean and okay.  Problems were with magnetic cards for access to rooms and elevators.  Worked at times but had to change at front desk twice.  Food service for lunch on top floor near pool bar  was spotty.  Half the menu was not available and long time for service.Problems with internet connections but IT staff worked hard to rectify but should not have had to call on them twice to resolve connections.  So decent hotel with some problems so only average grade in total.","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not quite 5 value","I stayed in this hotel for 3 days on a business trip, which was my first experience of this facility, The construction quality is exceptional , with lovely finishing touches and trimmings. This extends to the rooms as well, plenty of space and clever use of glass panels to add artistic ambiance. The bed provides the highest possible comfort. On top of that, the staff is friendly and professional.Bearing my earlier comments in mind, it should provide a solid platform to impress the guest with a memorable experience. Unfortunately significant flaws became apparent. The fillet steak served at dinner was overdone and dry ( ordered medium). Only one side dish served as standard, with my vegetable choice bland and flavorless. Some of the ordered choices at our table were delivered incorrectly. Wrong bill presented to our table. Magnetic room cards frequently lost their information, requiring us to return to the reception desk for reprogramming before entering the room or operating the lift, The lifts, although modern and moving swiftly, required patience for arrival. One of the biggest disappointments was the executive lounge, with peanuts as the primary snack. Wireless is available for a fee, if the guest manage to log in. Out of group of 4 people, only one progressed to successfully use the wireless.In summary, whilst not an unpleasant place to stay, it does not compare well with competitors operating in this hotel category.","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Beautiful Rooms but Terrible Dinner Service","I am hesitant about recommending this Hilton because of our dining experience, but will still give it a ""very good"" rating.  Just don't even think of having dinner there!  First, for the positive.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and very well-appointed.  They are modern and spacious.  The architecture of the building is very attractive, and the common areas are comfortable with modern furniture.  They have a roof-top pool with a lovely view.  The shop, although expensive, had a very nice selection of local and regional items.  As for the negative, this must be one of the last hotels in the World to charge for the internet, and at an exorbitant rate as another reviewer pointed out.  Our experience with dinner, unfortunately, was not commensurate with what one would expect at a luxury hotel.  The dining room was quite full that evening and inadequately staffed evidently for a large crowd.  We didn't really understand why - except perhaps that this was a Sunday night?  We were seated at a table that had not been properly cleaned from the previous guests.  We were missing cutlery and napkins, which after 20 minutes of waiting, we ended up pilfering ourselves from another area of the dining room which was evidently laid out for breakfast the next morning.  It took about 45 minutes for our order to be taken.  At this point, we were worried that the kitchen might close before we were served.  We asked for a bread basket since the food was taking so long.  After 15 minutes of waiting, we again resorted to self-service and grabbed a basket ourselves.  The manager was around but seemed completely oblivious to our plight.  The only person who provided decent service and whom we tipped later was the Maitre'D.  She managed to get us a cheese plate for dessert even though we had been told that the kitchen was out of cheese!  Anyway, mixed feelings...","Date of stay: January 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Sch√∂ne Bar on top, Pool im Barbereich ist aber zu klein und es f√ºhlt sich komisch an, zwischen Barg√§sten den Pool zu benutzen. Gym ungen√ºgend ausger√ºstet im Kraftbereich.

"Great way to start a holiday","What a great way to start the holiday. We arrived after a 10 hour journey to the newest hotel in Windhoek. Check in was easy- always a good start. I like the fresh minimalistic look of the hotel.The room was great and the beds super comfortable. My only complaint would be the bathrooms. I am not all for this open door concept. The tub was great and large but no where to put the soap or shampoo. Lived the rooftop bar. Looking forward to a night at the Hilton before we leave.Breakfast was super nice.","Date of stay: December 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"One of the better options in Windhoek","I've stayed at the Windhoek Hilton twice now. November 2012 & November 2013.Both times have been pleasant and unproblematic, and you can't beat the location for access on foot to the city centre, the parliament gardens and the Kristuskirche. It also conveniently sits on the main access roads to the big airport and Klein Windhoek in the one direction, and the shortest route to the city bypass/main route connecting North and South. I don't recall being bothered by traffic noise when the windows are closed (air con on).The rooms are a good size and the beds in the double-doubles are comfy with soft linen. The bathrooms are a bit avante guarde for my personal taste in that they're quite ""open plan"" with the room and involve panels of frosted glass here and there, which is (a) great for adult shadow puppet shows, (b) mildly interesting if you're sharing the room with a loved one and (c) could make for some rather unique holiday memories if there are four adults sharing.The Sky Bar views are lovely, particularly at sunset, however it does seem to be quite a popular drinking hole for the local beautiful people and gets phenomenally crowded with non-resident guests. I wasn't brave enough to have a swim amongst all the bar throng, but some people didn't seem to mind.I was pleased that the Hilton appears to have stopped charging their overnight guests for underground parking in their own building. Although the daily rate in 2012 wasn't extortionate, it did seem an unnecessary annoyance last time. The wi-fi isn't free. It isn't expensive either, but to Europeans used to it being standard and available all over, again, it does come across as an annoying petty revenue stream. In 2012, our room was just outside the reach of the wi-fi transmitter, so the best reception was sitting on the floor outside the room. In 2013 we were fairly close to the lifts and the reception in the room was fine. When a remote tent camp in Sossusvlei can manage free wi-fi, it does seem reasonable that the Hilton brand could chuck it in free too.The breakfast buffet isnt bad, but a limited number of staff are trying to do too many tasks, like serve coffee, clear tables, lay tables and replenish the buffet. And none of them very well as a result. It would probably ease some of the stressload if the coffee was self-service from an urn, rather than guests needing to catch the eye of the over-busy lady zealously guarding the flask. The ladies cooking the eggs to order are just fabulous and their omelettes are lovely. The lifts this visit were a bit confusing at first as nobody had mentioned you needed to touch your key card to the panel to activate the buttons to the room floors. Consequently I had a few extra journeys back and forth from the sky bar to the lobby before the penny dropped. And then the second penny dropped as to why this was possibly the case.I can't comment on the restaurants in the hotel, or the room service as we were keen to explore and eat out. We didn't have a bottle opener in our room for a cold beer from the mini bar, but I guess we could have rung housekeeping if we didn't already have our own with us.The lobby staff were attentive and effective.It's a pleasant enough hotel - certainly one of the better ones in Windhoek. Clearly not in everybody's budget but there are savings to be had with advanced payment. We'll be staying there again next visit.","Date of stay: November 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Central & modern, but anonymous service","I spent one night at the Hilton in Windhoek, a new property centrally located, with great terrace bar and spa.  The rooms are elegant but there is no separation between the bedroom and bathroom. You have to pay for wifi and breakfast separately.  The front desk staff is not terribly friendly. For what you pay,  you don't really feel all that welcome.","Date of stay: October 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The Amamazing Hilton Windhoek","Hilton Windhoek is.....(one word)....AMAZING!!!!! I have been to Hilton Sandton, Hilton Cape Town, Hilton Double Tree in Cape Town, but I am sure amazed by our own Hilton here in Namibia. The staff seem very well trained, they have customer care service and guest relations etiquette. But most of all, the comfort and ambiance surrounding the hotel is refreshing.","Date of stay: August 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Als Zwischenstop vor und nach Rundreise bestens geeignet","Das Hilton liegt sehr zentral hat aber derzeit neben sich den Baustellenl√§rm von der Bank of Namibia Baustelle vor dem Supreme Court. Die andere Seite ist aber deutlich ruhiger.Die Dachterrasse ist als Aussichtspunkt empfehlenswert speziell zum Sundowner und f√ºr kleine Snacks. Ordentliches Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet mit grosser Auswahl. Die Zimmer sind sehr ordentlich und fallen durch ihr spezielle Design des Nassbereiches - als Raumteiler auf.Der Conciergeservice ist sehr d√ºrftig und am bestens geht man gleich zu Windhoek Information.Insgesamt ein modernes Hotel aber mit wenig lokalem Ambient im Publikumsbereich.","Date of stay: July 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Best hotel in Windhoek - pricey but good quality","This Hilton does not fall short of expectations you can have of a good business hotel and even provides you with a bit more services than the usual hotel.Very nice room with good facilities.One issue is the price which seems to be the highest in Windhoek for a night. Beware, the Internet is available but is extra ! I tought that at that price, it could have been included. So is the parking !Dont forget to use the gym and /or the pool on the top floor in the morning to start a great day.There is a lounge bar with jazz bands playing every night + a very good restaurant that attracts people from the town. Try it : their beef filet medium rare was excellent and service was slick !","Date of stay: April 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lovely, Great Location","This hotel was wonderful.  Check-in was quick and easy.  I scheduled a taxi to take me to the airport when I checked out.  It was only $35.  The staff was very helpful.  My room was wonderful.  The bed was comfortable with great sheets.  The bathroom was roomy with great lighting and a nice big mirror.  The shower was separate from the tub.  You would not want to stay here with a business colleague though because there was no door separating the room from the bathroom.  The toilet is in its own room, however.  The only annoying part was there were no outlets in the bathroom to plug things in except for a shaver.  Why wouldn't there be outlets for a blow dryer and curling iron?  I ate dinner in the more upscale restaurant.  The steak was wonderful, as was the wine.  Plus, it was really inexpensive.  We then grabbed some drinks at the bar, which was also nice.  The free breakfast in the morning is incredible.  There is so much to pick from.  The only major downfall was the lack of free wifi.  You couldn't even get free wifi in the lobby.  The hotel is in a great location for shopping.  It's a couple minute walk to great souvenir shops and a mall.  I would stay here again.","Date of stay: November 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"a home away from home!","Windhoek Hilton is centrally located next to the Kalahari Sands hotel (have not stayed there) and has an amazing view of the downtown and the mountains surounding the city. The rooms are well furnished and brand new. The rooftop swimming pool is rather small and thin but has a sky bar facing the pool and with a view of the city. Many seem to enjoy the rooftop Sky bar. The restaurant is excellent. If you stay on a room only basis, complementary breakfast is offered. Breakfast is wide and varied including crusty croissants, warm food and meat. A good selection of fresh fruit juices and an excellent array of fine teas. We were with children and received an adjoining room with twin beds free of charge. Staff are happy to see the small children, even when they make a bit of noise in the restaurant. It is a childfriendly country. There is free parking. The only downside is the room service. It is extremely slow and the staff are not on a five star level with the knowledge of food. The chef prepares excellent food but the waitress or the cook on duty who brings it can mix it up. When I ordered ""pasta with pesto"" they managed to put vegetables with the pesto and the on top of it, brought ""'kech up"" just incase I find it too ""boring"". The waitress actually looked pitiful at me who would eat a green sauce. But the staff are extremely nice and gave me a 50 % discount to apologise for mixing up the order. In general it was a great stay and I would complain of nothing.","Date of stay: September 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The staff are excellent, the room was clean tidy well appointed and the service areas all well equipped and laid out.  A short stop for me overnight but the staff were there for all my needs.

AND cheap. Paid around $135 per night in Sep 2011, which is a steal for this kind of hotel. I suppose it's only this cheap because it has not much repeat business yet, which will surely change....","Date of stay: September 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Service needs attention","The facilities at the hotel were excellent and the decor inn the foyer was very appropriate to Namibia. The room I stayed in had an extremely comfortable bed and was beautifully decorated. I would return in the hope the the niggles I mention below will have been addrressed,The temerature of the water during my shower fluctauated continuously without my adjusting the tap, varying from uncomfortably hot water to cold water in an instant. What also needs attention is the level of service provided. despite the staff I met being eager to please there were some problems. I alerted the IT department thatt the internet in my room was not working. Very soon after an maintenance person arrived but could not fix the problem, stating that a technical person from T would need to attend to the problem, only to be told then that this could not happen as the IT person was asleep - this at 20:30!. The other incident was when I went down for breakfast at 07:20. I arrived to closed doors, with the explanation that the restaurant manager had not arrived yet to open the doors despite the opening hour being 07:00. A staff member did kindly offer to take my order and bring my breakfast up to my room, which they did within 12 minutes - but unfortunately did not deliver what I had ordered.","Date of stay: June 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

No porter on arrival to take bags to room.  The rooms are clean but tired. Breakfast included in room rate but they want to charge additional for having a capuccino with breakfast. Who charges extra for coffee with breakfast? This is unheard of - especially at ¬£350 a night. Way over-priced.

"DISAPPOINTED GUEST","2 weeks ago I stayed at the Hilton in Windhoek for 3 nights. Given that the Hilton claims to be 5 star I was rather disappointed with a number of issues. Whilst the staff were very friendly that unfortunately does not make up for the following:1.	Arrived around 12H20 on the Monday. I was pre booked on the system but no non smoking rooms  available at that stage so I said I would wait in the foyer until my room was available. I was sitting in full sight of the reception. Eventually at 14Hoo I went back and was then told my room was ready. Why not call me as soon as it was ‚Äì not leave me to wait?2.	Whilst waiting I decided I would like a sandwich. Ordered a pastrami on rye ‚Äì fairly standard.. After a few minutes sorry not available. Asked what is available ‚Äì nothing. This is a 5 star hotel with no sandwiches available?3.	That evening ate in the Restaurant. At least 4 courses on the al le carte not available ‚Äì this is a 5 star hotel in a city that is certainly not a backwater of the world. Why retain the dishes if you cannot offer them4.	Ordered a 200gm sirloin medium rare. Even the Dros and Spur (fast food outlets) can get that right. Overdone. Should have sent it back but I was tired. They offered free dessert as compensation which my companions enjoyed. 5.	Next night still dishes not available so had buffet. For a 5 star not up to scratch. In fact eaten better in a 2/3 star6.	Wednesday night German buffet. Quite honestly the chef needs to visit Germany and Austria to really understand the delicacies of Germanic food and how it should be properly served.  Perhaps folk from outside Europe who have never visited Germany and Austria may think it was fine. I did not. 7.	I use the gym/fitness station. The one morning at 6H30 no towels no paper cups and the place was a mess. Many executives like to exercise before work. That was not inviting.8.	Last night of my stay only 1 milk sachet on the self service refreshments in the room. Therefore either tea before bed or coffee in the morning. Not both. I know there is a limited range of competition in Windhoek but this Hotel really needs to look to its laurelsPieter Williams","Date of stay: September 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good location","Stayed here for 1 night at the end of a Namibian safari and the hotel is in an excellent location.Only a few minutes walk to the craft market, the airport is not too far away and there are various shops on the doorstep as well.The roof bar is very good for having a drink to watch the sun go down also.The room was clean and comfortable and consistent with Hilton's international standards.","Date of stay: September 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Shabby looking furniture and broken appliances ","+ nice big room, comfortable bed+ great view from sky bar - our iron was broken. I asked for a working one and was promised one right away but never got it - one sliding door missing, the other one broken- not functioning light switch- hotel staff opening room door without knocking (it was apparently to give us a ‚Äògood night‚Äò chocolate which we never got) - hotel staff knocking on door at 7.50 am without reason. (‚ÄòOh, we come back later‚Äô)All in all I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the hotel.

"Good hotel, but lack of service","We stayed at Hilton for several nights. Rooms were clean, breakfast was good and the gym and pool were good as well, but every single day we were missing towels in our room, got completely different service level than our friends in the next room (we had one reservation done together) and never got apologized for the bad service we got. We were 6 girls traveling and had booked 2 rooms of 3 people. The others got big beds and we needed to share a 120 cm wide bed, which obviously didn't give us good sleep. We never had towels for 3 even though every night we had paid a lot of extra for the 3rd person, called the reception several times and went to take there face to face, while the other room of 3 had bathrobes, slippers, chocolates etc. in their room all the time for everyone. Therefore I felt that in our case Hilton was totally overpriced and didn't meet the expectations. We paid the very same price for the room and got tremendously worse service than our friends. And even though we pointed this out many times for Hilton staff, they did nothing, which was the worse thing to happen.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Worst Hilton Ever","This is seriously the worst Hilton I have ever stayed in.  From the nonchalant, non caring staff, to the towels with big holes in them, to Internet that doesn't work with Apple devices, to the lack of any amenities in the room (iron, minibar etc).  Just a woeful experience. How you can charge NAD$1880 per night, call yourself a Hilton and treat your guests like this is beyond me. Do yourself a favor and stay at a 3 star hotel for half the price and I will guarantee you will have a better stay.","Date of stay: March 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"good place shabby guests and sub standard management","Overall impressed by the Hilton though one incident had me leaving with a bad taste and I wont be returning to stay here again. The good bits first the breakfast was very good great choice of traditional and healthy breakfast items. Rooms were good and clean but that what I would expect. I dont appreciate having to pay for a WiFi connection in this type of hotel from the room when the public areas are free. Cheapskates. Myself and a colleague had a particular unpleasant incident in the bar area. Four local guys who had obviously been on the sauce all day were very verbal and keen to spout all sorts of racial abuse in our general direction. We asked to see the manager after the bar staff refused to intervene. The manager wasn't much better and showed no backbone in dealing with the matter. The group eventually left only to return 20 mins later.          Not the sort of thing you expect in a 4 star hotel bar.

"This is non a Hilton and it's not a Five stars hotel","Poor service both management and staff. 45 min for a club sandwich?! 45 min to discover that what you ordered is not available anymore.?!Broken shower...water all over. Mini bar with rests of previous guest. Poor cleaning specially in bathroom. An this did not happen only to us but also two our friends travelling with us. It was not high season so the hotel was not fully booked. So we cannot consider this as a one off accident. Simply this hotel does not meet the standards of it's brand  and of the 5stars rating. When you don't know a city and you cannot rely on advices...the only thing you can rely on are international standards...well this was not the case.","Date of stay: February 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice place for a night","We stayed at Hilton Windhoek on our trip to Namibia. The hotel is good, it is a new hotel. The rooms are just like rooms in Europe hotels from Hilton. A very good bed and bathroom. We also had diner at the hotel and that was also very good. Ask for the butternut risotto.The breakfast is good with a wide choice off things. The only thing that is not like Hilton are the elevators, they are very slow. If you use the elevator that is used for the baggage it is oke.","Date of stay: May 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I Enjoyed My 1st Hilton Experiance .......But","This is a amendment to my review posted in early September - I was lucky to sample the Hilton experience 3 times over a 3 week period , I was working offshore and when flying into Windhoek I was lucky to stay in the Hilton overnight before continuing my journey to Joburg / London the next day .The Hilton in Windhoek has a unique turret type design , checking in reception was quick and the staff were very professional .The lobby reception decor was very pleasing on the eye and a short elevator journey to my room I was "" gob smacked "" with everything about the room , king sized bed - well designed on suite bathroom , very clean and well presented .After checking out the hotel on the Internet I was looking forward to going up to then 9th floor to check out the roof top bar , pool and chill out area and I was not disappointed .The views of Windhoek and beyond we're brilliant and a cheeky brandy and ginger (my 1st drink for 5 weeks) was just the ticket to soak in the views. There is a 24 hour Gym to keep you fit and healthy but I'm sorry to say a few more drinks was my priority .When I thought all my boxes had been ticked night time changed the Sky bar vibe from a day time sunny chill out zone to a buzzing night time up beat experience and the nightime views of the city did not disappoint .A few more drinks later I returned to my room to watch a bit of TV and to have a meal and then get a good nights kip before a early start in the morning .Below there are 2 different meal reviews one for a meal I had delivered to my room and the the 2nd was a meal I had in the Exipa.For my 1st meal I  decided to order some room service , baby chicken with sweet potato fries & salad  the room menu sold me my meal choice and I couldn't wait to tuck into some 5 star Hilton Style cooking and  the food arrived and it was ""cooking eye candy"" on a plate .The chicken was cooked to perfection end the sweet potato fries were naughty but part of my 5 a day health option so I didn't feel guilty eating them all , a early visit to the gym this morning made it all worth while .The night before I order breakfast to my room , cereal , toast and british tea what a way to start my day .My 2nd meal review which was on my last visit to the Hilton "" 27 Sept ""After settling in to my room and having a shower to freshen up I decided to have a meal in the Hotel Exipa resteraunt with a co-worker who was also staying a few days before travelling home .I love a good steak so I ordered the "" Rib eye "" steak , the resteraunt waitress sold me the steak and I was drooling with antisipation waiting for my meal .When it arrived the steak was a little small but with the sweet potatoe fries and salad my plate was full , I ordered my steak to be cooked medium to well done .But after cutting my first steak mouthful I realised the meat choice was poor quality , tasteless , and chewy .Infact I couldn't swallow it , I then tried another slice and it was just as bad .The waitress came to our table and asked how are meals were my friend said his burger was excellent but I had to be honest and say I couldn't eat my steak .I know it's not the waitresses fault but I said I couldn't believe that a restaurant associated with the HIlton brand could serve up a poor steak .My work colleagues on the rig who have stayed at the Hilton did warn me about the poor steaks but I didn't believe then until I tried it for myself .I wasnt charged for my meal but I was left disappointed that no one else has complained about their steaks .I didn't go to bed hungry we took the elevator up to the 9th floor and I had a drink and bar snack overlooking the stunning night views of Windhoek .The next day I contacted the hotel manager to give him my feedback of my steak experiance and he did say he was going to discuss with the catering manager why the Hilton was buying poor cuts of meat and serving them to customers I also discussed my other issue with him and that was why isn't WiFi free in the hotel , and  the cost was $20 plus per day per appliance so if you had a laptop , a iPad and a iPhone and you wanted hotel Internet .....do the maths .Again he said it was something the hotel was looking into , so the hotel must be coining it in with the Internet .The clientele you have from all corners of the world need free Internet , Mr Hilton must spend millions keeping his hotels at their best , having free Internet will go a long way to looking after all your customers needs .But I don't want to finish on a negative I loved my Hilton experience , the hotel has it all , the rooms and facilities are excellent unfortunately because of my steak and the Internet issues I can't give you 5 stars .But if the manager acts on the customers feedback the Hilton Windhoek will be ready to fly the Hilton flag for Namibia .","Date of stay: September 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Right stop before departure","It is a good spot for the night before the flight, it is only 40 minutes max from Windhoek airport and really close to the centre.The rooms are wide and clean and they offer a good sleep. The service is a little bit confusional (no one knew where our car was parked and the bags took a while before being delivered to the room).The rooftop has a nice view on the city.

"Paradise by the traffic light...","We stayed 2 nights at this hotel on the main road of Windhoek and went a little bit overboard with the type of room: the garden room on the executive 9th floor. It is lovely. You have your own huge balcony measuring approximately 10x10 meters half of which is a garden! The room comes with free breakfast and buffet dinner in a small executive lounge. So treat yourself and go for it. AND if you need a male haircut just cross the street where you find TATEKULU barbershop. Really excellent!!! You get far more than you can imagine. The result is stunning. So go anyway just for the experience!!!","Date of stay: February 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice hotel, but i was expecting more.","We decided to do a quick 2 day tour of Namibia, the hotel of choice in Windhoek was the Hilton. By far the biggest establishment in the town. I had a specific requirement and Irma Kubas (PA to the GM) was amazing in getting me sorted. The rooms were decent, modern and clean. The menu offerings are good enough to satisfy most needs. The jewel of the establishment has to be the Sky Bar, situated on the 9th floor it gives access to views of the city, a lap pool and of course the bar. The internet connectivity was a big let down, i was told that there was only 10mb available to hotel guests, and this made it almost impossible to do any meaningful work that required an internet connection. I guess i dont really need to say this, but please lock away your valuables, i was silly enough to leave money lying around and needless to say after the cleaning staff had been by a portion of it had vanished.","Date of stay: December 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Eerste overnachting tijdens groepsreis","Het hotel is mooi, mlaar de service aan de receptie laat te wensen over.  Bij aankomst waren een aantal kamers klaar, maar  3 kamers nog niet. Dat is aanvaardbaar aangezien we daar in de vroege namiddag aankwamen. Maar dat het  3 uur duurt om de laatste 3 kamers klaar te maken is te veel. Met 6 personen hebben we  3 uur gewacht. De enige plaats was de bar, de mensen die er de service deden waren behulpzaam, maar ook daar verliep alles moeilijk en niet vlot.Alles duurde zeer lang.  Ik denk dat er veel mankeert aan de leiding van het hotel.","Date of stay: December 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comfort and style","The Hilton Hotel at Windhoek has only one fault as far as I am concerned - it's damn near impossible to find the hairdryer, because it's in a drawer under the desk, a drawer that doesn't even look like a drawer. Apart from that everything is fine, and service is very good. When I asked housekeeping for just a sheet instead of the duvet, it appeared within minutes.","Date of stay: September 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A decent place to stay!","After long flights and feeling exhausted this was an oasis in the desert! (well, in Windhoek anyway). Easy to find off the main road in from the airport, with easy check in, valet parking (at a small cost) in the basement and decent breakfast. The sky bar is worth a visit for a sundowner and does decent food. Nothing negative to say after a one night stay - the key for us was that this was so easy to find.....","Date of stay: July 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Roof top swimming pool leak through the roof to the 5th floor!","I have stayed at this hotel several times. It has always been good and still is many ways. However I will not stay again until they have fixed what I believe to be a major risk to safety of guests. The roof top swimming pool is leaking and obviously has been for some time, so much so that it has caused damage to the marble flooring on the 5th floor, 4 floors below. I am not a structural engineer, but would guess it is only a matter of time until the ceiling on the 9th floor collapses causing a potential risk to life below.I reported this to reception who claimed they were unaware, which I do not believe. They didn't to the best of my knowledge even report it.","Date of stay: January 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice end to Holiday","This was last stop on 3 week trip to Namibia.Lovely hotel with very modern decor.Nice roof top bar to view the sunset before a nice meal in the restaurant.Only criticism, which I am sure a lot of people will point out, is that there is a lot of construction work going on around the Hotel.   We arrived on a Sunday so all was quiet as no work being done on Sunday but come Monday morning and it was very noisy.This is obviously something the Hotel has no control of and is no way intended as a criticism of the Hotel.There is parking under the Hotel and free wifi is available in lobby area and on the roof.    It has to be paid for to be used in room.","Date of stay: September 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sky Bar: Only the view is five star","This is not a review of the hotel, since I haven't stayed there. It is a review only of the sky bar on top of the building. The best view you can get of Windhoek, the place to be for a sunset drink (the sundowner, never to be missed anywhere, and definitely not in Africa). So, location wise, nothing can beat the bar. Service wise, I doubt that any shebeen in Katutura could be worse (no offense, guys...). Spent a number of sunsets up there, and the service experience was frightful every single time. First of all, you wait for a long, long time, despite your best efforts, before anyone of the staff believes you might be worth their attention. Second, once you managed to catch their attention, you will find that not all is as it seems. Order a bottle of wine from the menu not everyone orders, and all you hear is ""we don't have this"". Insist, and you might convince people that looking into the fridge might help. And when you order a second bottle of the same wine, chances are you will be told that it might take a while before that bottle has been brought up from the restaurant. Last time I was there, getting the bottle took the better part of an hour. Not to forget that I was once told there was no Coke. Or that the parking boom didn't work, even though everything had been paid at reception. And on and on the lousy service stories go. So, all in all: Location - excellent. Service - unspeakable, given that the place's pretension is to be five star. Do go there for the view. And brace for a one of a kind five star service experience.","Date of stay: July 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Wonderful Service","When you're greeted warmly upon entry and each time you show your face, how bad can it be? Service is excellent. The rooms are well appointed. Security is excellent because it's there but very unobtrusive. Location is good. The rooms are comfortable, well maintained, and very comfortable. I recommend you check the electrical connections for the hotel and Namibia and plan accordingly. Overall a very acceptable property above the standard Hilton excellence.","Date of stay: April 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Had issues but ended up happy","It first started when we arrived at the airport. I had arranged for pick up with the hotel last year already after accommodation booking was confirmed. To our surprise there was no one waiting for us. We had to ask information desk at the airport to phone the hotel to find out what was going on. We spend almost two hours at the hotel before we were collected. On arrival the room became an issue. The room i had booked was king deluxe room and special request was smoking room. We were informed that the room we had booked is non-smoking as it was on a non-smoking floor. We were offered a standard room instead which we refused. We were very frustrated and disappointed as we were expecting the best from Hilton hotel. We were eventually offered a room with a garden balcony. Still had issues because the floor was licking. We ended up on seventh floor which was great. We also had access to the executive floor. We only had supper and breakfast , then we decided it was better for us to buy food elsewhere. In my opinion the food is not wow in the executive launch. The standard was not up to my expectations, The only thing i enjoyed was the drinks. The room was great , spacious and to my expectations.I was not happy with the cleaning of the rooms as there was a day where cleaning was not offered at all. What i can say is after a few complaints we were eventually happy but my concern is that must one complain before they get what they want or what they have asked for. I have been to Hilton Shanghai , Hilton Durban but it was the first time i felt disappointed on my arrival at the hotel. Wifi is only in public areas so i had to pay to use it in the room.","Date of stay: February 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"5 Sterne Hotel mit 1 Stern Service","Einfach schlecht. Jedes mal als ich an der Rezeption war, waren andere G√§ste da, die sich beschwert hatten. Ich war offensichtlich nicht der einzige, der mehrfache Probleme hatte in diesem Hotel.   Das gebuchte Zimmer war nicht verf√ºgbar und sie haben uns eine Suite gegeben und wollten ein Zusatzbett in das Zimmer bringen. Nach gef√ºllte 1000 mal hin und her kam das Zusatzbett erst gegen Mitternacht.   Viele Sachen in diesem Hotel funktionieren einfach nicht:   Der Aufzug ist einfach so von alleine hoch und runter gefahren und wollte uns anscheinend nicht auslassen. Wir haben die erste Gelegenheit genutzt und sind ausgestiegen und runtergelaufen.   Das Wasser vom Dachterrassenpool tropft runter in die Halle.   Es gab exponierte Stromleitungen im Schrank zu sehen.  Das Geruch von der Klimaanlage war unertr√§glich.   Es gab viele Flecken auf dem Teppich im Zimmer. Die M√∂bel waren alt und weisten Verbrauchsspuren auf.  Das Wasser f√ºr die Dusche war entweder hei√ü oder sehr hei√ü.   Beim runterlaufen im Treppenhaus war der Fluchtweg nicht erkennbar. Die T√ºr im Erdgeschoss war abgeschlossen. Ich frage mich wie man in einer Notsituation das Geb√§ude verlassen soll.","Date of stay: December 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Perfekte Lage und Zimmer mit Wohlf√ºhlfaktor","Im Umkreis von 5 Gehminuten finden sich die bekanntesten Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten von Windhoek, so dass das Hotel insbesondere f√ºr einen Kurzaufenthalt bestens geeignet ist (wir sind gegen 16:30 Uhr eingetroffen, am n√§chsten Morgen abgereist und konnten uns dennoch fast alles anschauen).Das Hotel verf√ºgt √ºber eine sehr sch√∂nen, auf dem Dach gelegenen kleinen Swimmingpool. Leider vergeht einem die Lust auf Nutzung (es sei denn, man ist Exhibitionist), da die dahinter stehenden Liegen nicht von Poolnutzern sondern Besuchern der Dachbar genutzt werden, die full dressed ihre Cocktails schl√ºrfen.Die Zimmer sind der Kategorie entsprechend eingerichtet. Auffallend ist die herausragende Gestaltung des Sanit√§rbereichs.Das Fr√ºhst√ºck l√§sst nur wenige W√ºnsche offen. Allerdings hatte ich den Eindruck, dass zum Ende der Fr√ºhst√ºckszeit nicht mehr der gesamte Service angeboten wird.Wi-Fi in der Lobby kostenlos (funktioniert auch gut), im Zimmer kostenpflichtig (Tagespauschale OK, Stundenpauschale recht teuer).Aktuell sollte beachtet werden, dass um das Hotel herum intensiv gebaut wird, was sich auf das gesamte Ambiente etwas negativ auswirkt (und die PKW-Anreise erschwert; wir mussten mit unerem nicht gro√üstadttauglichen Wagen zwei Runden um mehrere Blocks drehen).Gesamturteil 4,5 von 5,0 (Abstriche f√ºr Pool und Fr√ºhst√ºck).","Date of stay: October 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"They Just Don't Get It","The staff at this hotel just doesn't understand the concept of urgency with regards to customer complaints.  We had multiple problems during our stay-ranging from the internet not working properly to housekeeping forgetting to leave bathroom amenities after they cleaned our room and in each instance we had to call repeated before we got a response or resolution.  Under the circumstances I can't recommend this hotel.","Date of stay: July 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good Hotel for a short stay before your start exploring","We stayed at the Hilton in central Windhoek 1 night before and 1 night after we explored Namibia and we believe that was exactly the right thing to do. There are a few nice spots in Windhoek but from our point of view there would not have much of a point to stay longer.The 2 different rooms we had were nice and tidy. They are just what you would expect from a Hilton. People at the reception were welcoming and helpful, but much too slow when we wanted to check out in the middle of the night when they also forgot to prepare the breakfast box that they offered us the day before. Anyway,this was nothing of major importance. We enjoyed the short time we spent at the Hilton. The rooftop bar is worth a visit even for people not staying at the hotel.We would recommend the hilton to anyone! It was nice and met our expectations.","Date of stay: March 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Redeemed","We went back after our last unpleasant stay and gave the unit a chance of redemption. The overall performance improved dramatically from the last experience with the porter staff welcoming us in the basement parking lot to transport our luggage to reception and beyond.  I was impressed.  we were given a room on the east side of the building which was very comfortable, spacious and well illuminated in day time.  Problem though was that part of the light streamed through a large ""milky"" glass window with no blind to cover the light at night which disturbed my sleep endlessly. We lodged a complaint and the maintenance team came to investigate and never brought a solution for our entire stay.  I will probably go back but insist on a room in a different position.","Date of stay: March 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Snackbar im 9.

Es war zu dem Zeitpunkt absolut kein Andrang, neben uns nur ein weiterer Gast.Auf eine Beschwerde hin, dass das Fleisch kalt sei, hatte man uns angeboten, es zu erw√§rmen.

"Good place to stay for business or leisure","4 of us stayed here at the start of our weekend for 1 night only , from check in to check out, we were impressed with the service, the staff and the rooms. The rooms are large and really modern, everything is new and works brilliantly, the bathroom is large i loved it. This hotel has been designed for long or short stays, for businessmen or people travelling on Holiday. It has 2 restuarants one incorporates the bar on the roof top, with lovely nighttime views of Windhoek under lights. Seems like a place for locals to visit too, i had a lovely vibe. It's close to restuarants, and shops, and offers parking as well.Overrall we had a fantastic stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again should I return to Windhoek.","Date of stay: March 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good but not 5/5","We stayed here twice in the last two weeks. We booked a deluxe room on both stays and as a Hilton Gold member it was fair t9 expect an upgrade b7t none were available . We were however given access to the Executive lounge which was great. The first stay, the staff member in the executive lounge was lovely, second stay she was surly and shut all the drinks away at 8pm which we did not expect as the lounge closes at 10pm. Stay 1:was better overall with lovely desk staff too.Stay 2 - another room next to the lift which my account states room away from elevator. Chips in cups in room and on soap holder, stained carpets, fused plug points - room 201 FYI. Only one robe and pair of slippers and only one bottle of water strangely. However, it is  close to the Museum and African craft market. Parking costs ¬£4 per day - NAD 60 . The car park is small and the angles are very tight. Rooftop bar is lovely for a sundowner cocktail.  Overall, small but important improvements ,ents could be made. Fridge in room which was handy.","Date of stay: September 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Receptionist  was very rude and impatient with us. We asked to speak to the Duty manager so we could explain what we were promised prior to booking. Receptionist told us that the duty manager refused to see us and her decision was final. The duty manager only came a few minutes to assist a client who came later than us. Later on He attended to us of which initially he was even impolite. After check-inn noone showed us which way to go. Both receptionist and manager were just looking at us. We ended up pushing our own trolley, thats when they asked the security to help us. This made our stay unbearable. It was supposed to be  a fantastic birthday get away but ended up being the worst experiance of my life.

"Phenomenal staff, very eager to please  ","After a lengthy second voyage through Namibia with a colleague stayed here upon returning to Windhoek. It was immediately clear the staff are exceptional, and having stayed at Hiltons on multiple continents I can confidently tell you they are absolutely among the company's very best!I did really love the rooftop lounge and the bar/pool area. It is a great place to unwind. Also the executive lounge is well-appointed with good amenities. If you are traveling for business I would however recommend getting multiple rooms (rather than sharing a room with two beds) due to the hotel design; these rooms have an open format that lacks privacy. The upper floors have good views of the city and mountains. We had one minor glitch, and the concierge was very gracious to immediately make things wonderful. The property's location is ideal -- you can easily and quickly walk from the hotel all around the central business district by day.

"Central location and helpful front desk!","Great stay at the Hilton Windhoek! It was a weekend so the streets were quiet, but enjoyed the central location.  Very friendly front desk who showed me how to walk to the church and to the Nambian Craft Centre.  The included breakfast buffet was delicious and the chef herself stopped by every table to say hello and check on us.  The overall architecture of the hotel is stunning from the two-level lobby to the enclosed atrium where the rooms are located to the rooftop pool and bar where you can watch the sunset over all the tall buildings nearby. When leaving for the airport, they have an airport shuttle service that was very helpful and convenient for about 358 Namibian dollars.  The airport is about 30-minutes away.  This is one of the best hotels in Windhoek.  I picked it last minute and was pleasantly surprised by my wonderful stay.","Date of stay: April 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice hotel but food can be much much better","Staying here for the third time, meaning I am quite pleased overall. The main issue is the food. The breakfast is OK, but would expect better bread and cereals in the morning. I ordered a club sandwich twice in the lobby for a quick lunch and two times it was just OK. I had lunch once in the main restaurant (28 March 2018) and ordered the tataki tuna. Far too much wasabi and half an hour later I had a high fever and rashes all over me, most likely food poisoning. This is unacceptable in a hotel linked to the Hilton chain. So yes, stay here but eat somewhere else ...","Date of stay: March 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"punto di partenza strategico","Ho appena terminato un tour in Namibia e ho soggiornato in questo hotel la prima e l'ultima notte. Situato in pieno centro a Windhoek, √® un ottimo punto di inizio e fine per un tour in Namibia, in quanto si trova a 40 km dall'aereoporto internazionale. Struttura di ottimo livello, camere confortevoli e spaziose, dotato di palestra e piscina esterna, parcheggio, personale gentilissimo e disponibile. Dotato di due ristoranti interni, uno con men√π internazionale e l'altro un sushi bar di discreta qualit√†. Buona l'offerta per la colazione. Incantevole la vista sulla citt√† che si pu√≤ godere dallo sky bar all'ultimo piano.","Date of stay: January 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very recommendable place to stay in Windhoek","We are a family of 4 and stayed for one day and night.  We arrived straight from the airport after having picked up our rental car elsewhere in Windhoek. Easy getting around and finding hotel. Parking no problem. Rooms were clean, beds very comfortable and no noise during night. Lovely shampoo, body lotions etc. Pool area upstairs very swanky and we truly enjoyed our time up there with the great bar food and wonderful small pool with a gorgous view overlooking the city. Only tiny complaint: we aited more than an hour for our late lunchtie burgers- apparently the staff somewhere forgot about our order. However- we were offered free drinks while they worked on sorting it out and all staff everywhere in the hotel were nice and friendly upon approach.  Great working wifi. We would definitely stay another time.","Date of stay: December 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Can do better!","Clean rooms, friendly staff, average kitchen, construction work in progress with cigarette smell filled passage way next to the casino.Half the wines on the looong menu were not available (they were on a storage room with no key to be found!) plus no Namibian wine on it!!! Same for some of the fish dishes on the menu that happened to be ‚Äòjust out of stock‚Äô during the four days we spent there...And the Sky bar clothes at 22:00...Had a long discussion with the receptionist who charged our bills with meals that we had already paid for (we had a half board - breakfast and dinner option). All was sorted out but I would have happily skipped the controversy.Also, this is the first hotel ever where I could not check out the evening before departure because the software ‚Äòmust click into midnight in order to count the last night of our stay‚Äô. Weird!So we did it at 03:00a.m just before departure.All in all a good experience but certainly this hotel can do better!","Date of stay: December 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sehr gutes Hotel in zentraler Lage","Wir waren hier ein paar Tage um uns Windhoek und Umgebung anzuschauen: Hatten ein Zimmer mit Dachterasse. Trotz der zentrale Lage war es hier sehr ruhig und angenehm zur Erholung geeignet. Im Zentrum Windhoeks war man in 1min. zu Fu√ü. Also kein Thema. Dachterassenpool inkl. Bar sind klasse, hier kann man es entspannt aushalten und der Fitnessbereich ist sauber und gut best√ºckt.","Date of stay: March 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappointed","After arriving at 4 in the afternoon following a long journey from Etosha (Namibia), the room was still not ready for check-in. We were told by the Front Desk that there is no standard check-in or check-out time. It took 30-40 mins for them to get the room ready during which as saving grace, we were offered complimentary wifi and coffee. However, the staff did not seem apologetic for the delay. When we had to go to the room, we were told we could take our luggage up ourselves. In general, we found the Front Desk unfriendly. Maybe there are cultural differences that we as tourists need to be mindful of, but in the service industry, I think the onus is on the service provider to be sensitive and kind. We were certainly expecting better from Hilton which is a well known hotel chain.","Date of stay: June 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Breakfasts are excellent with a great choice and the variously themed buffet dinners in the evening (local, Italian, Indian etc) are also very good. The Sky Bar and pool (although small) were great places to chill. Found the room to be noisy with people slamming doors at 3am and television dialogue travelling through the wall from the next room. Service is generally good with a few let-downs - some staff still haven't got the message that you don't scowl at guests even if they have a difficult request.

"The best Windhoek has to offer,  however too busy ","I spent 5 days in this hotel, the location is perfect,  close to many amenities,  the buffet restaurants were very good,  and skybar was excellent,  however the Sushi bar,  used very bad rice,  would not recommend it. The hotel is extremely busy,  which can be annoying,  and diminishes services. I felt services was appalling, I asked for an adaptor since I had a foreign laptop,  there was a pregnant lady at the front desk,  who just dismissed me,  by saying they did not have any left,  did not even bother looking for one,  I tried upgrading my room to have access to the business lounge like all the other Hiltons,  and I was told not possible. Would I recommend the hotel absolutely ,  however management needs to invest in more adaptors for foreign laptops and phones,  invest in training the front desk ladies to be more people friendly,  and train your red coat were securities to stop harassing guests every morning asking them whether they paid at checkout.","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Worthwhile and luxurious","This is a hotel that lives up to its name. I had read a couple of reviews prior to my stay but I did not have many negative experiences. The staff are very friendly, both at the front desk as well as the restaurants. The breakfasts are wonderful and if one has to leave early, a breakfast pack can be arranged. The room service however, is rather limited for vegetarians. I ordered a pizza and after 45 mins it came. Very disappointing as there were hardly any toppings and this was basically a cheese pizza. What I don't understand is that there is a fee for a 'tray service' and in addition one is required to tip.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ok","They were busy building a new hotel right next to our window - it was loud and a horrible view. The food was pretty average. Cleaning ladies took 20‚Ç¨ out my purse. Quite a few very simple and plain guests. High Internet costs (no free wifi) and high transport costs. Windhoek is horrible. Totally overpriced (food, water, wifi, transport etc). The breakfast buffet is not bad, but dinner is horrible there. Everyone could prepare a better dinner buffet. Pool is dirty and many funny people hanging around on the roof top (people from outside and some kind of ""ladies""). The rooms were clean, the bed was comfy and it's probably still one of the only addresses you may stay in Windhoek.","Date of stay: August 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Overnight stay","This was our 1st night of 5 in Namibia. We arrived in the afternoon so it was too late to try to drive to the desert. This was a nice choice, we had a nice room with a outside patio and view. We also had use of the executive lounge where you have a lovely view of the sun setting. The staff was very friendly and the room was comfortable and spacious. There were plenty of outlets for charging all the necessary items. We didn't explore the town, we were off to drive over 4 hours to our next destination. I am a Hilton honors member and would definitely stay there again the next time I am in Windhoek.","Date of stay: June 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Parking sting and communal aircon","On check out I was hit for an unexpected $60 for parking overnight. There is nowhere else to park for miles around. It was not specified in the estimate before I booked. Felt stung by this uninvoiced little aftershock.  The aircon is not individually controllable. You get a communal aircon setting. We got too hot and had a bad night as a result. Maintenance guy was attentive but ineffectual.  Don't try and use the many complicated buttons on the in-room phones. They don't correspond to the hotel's actual services. Just dial 0 and ask for what you want.","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice hotel","Stayed for one night before our tour.  We arrived late and our booking from Kayak did not show up but the front desk staff were very helpful and agreed to honor the Kayak price for our stay.  The rooms are very nice and comfortable and the breakfast buffet, which is included, was very good.  The only negative I would have is that the room service food isn't so good.  I had a caesar salad that consisted of lettuce, bacon, anchovies, eggs, and a mayo/miracle whip dressing.  No parmesan and no caesar dressing.  It was pretty yucky.  BUT the prices for room service are very reasonable.  They don't gouge because you are in your room. The staff was very nice and I would stay again.  Oh and the wifi is spotty in the rooms.  Sort of frustrating.","Date of stay: June 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Surprised they can actually rate this as a 5 star hotel","Stayed for 3 nights several weeks apart. Check in is okay but slow. Rooms are average size and beds are old and creaky - linen and pillows not in 5 star league by a long shot. On two seperate occasions my minibar was dead empty on check in , both times the air conditioner wouldn't work and the WIFI in room will drive you mad. Breakfast and dinner are in the 4 star league and pretty good. I believe there's much better value elsewhere. Considering this hotel charges the same price as the Intercontinental at Tambo airport the difference is night and day. Finally the spa is under - resourced and trying to get in for a massage after 25 hours of flying from the US or Australia was impossible.","Date of stay: May 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Dont expect much","Let me start with the positive aspect in that the front desk staff are friendly and the breakfast buffet is good but that's where it ends.   The general pace of service is very slow, try waiting half an hour for a glass of sparkling wine and a cocktail at the roof bar to hunting down a waitress for coffee at breakfast.   If you are an HHonours guest you will probably not find about the benefits you are entitled to until you leave including the free internet service which is very intermittent.   Then we have the issue of staff fidelity. I had gone out for dinner and upon my return I discovered that someone had been through my bag which was in the closet. Thankfully there was nothing of value in the bag but the fact remains that someone had rummaged through my stuff.","Date of stay: May 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good value with excellent location","The hotel is centrally located with easy access whilst being able to avoid traffic. The rooms are well equipped, food great and good value for money.

"Great hotel for pre/post safari","Great central location in town, 30 mins taxi from the airport,  nice spacious rooms and good breakfast buffet - one thing I would add is that room I stayed in would be a great  for a couple, but if you are sharing with someone who isnt a partner, has the potential to be slightly awkward as bathroom and bedroom are open pan!","Date of stay: August 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Typical Hilton style","Our friend dropped us off with 4 bags - 2 full of camping gear we didn't need overnight and we were checking out early in the morning, so the porter stored those for us. Check in was good and they arranged for a taxi in the morning. The room was big and the usual style,  but the shower and bathroom being open to the bedroom with no door  was a bit weird - not our style at all. The half lounge chair - not sure what you would call it, was really uncomfortable and hard to sit in. 2 ordinary chairs would have been much better. There was only  1 small shampoo and conditioner but housekeeping were pretty quick at delivering some more after a phone call. Had a pleasant drink at the rooftop bar which was refreshingly breezy. Cant comment on food as we didn't eat there for dinner and left too early, and breakfast is not included in the room rate. Check out at 6.30 am  took quite a while as they couldn't find cash to return my cash  deposit left the night before on check in, and the process re free internet for HH members being charged and then credited was also a small delay although that didn't appear on my bill. Overall Ok - nothing special.","Date of stay: March 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Perfect to start/end Namibia trip","This is a classic Hilton - we stayed one night prior to our flight departure. We were lucky to be upgraded to a stunning room with bathtub! Good service overall but a bit slow. The Skybar and Sky Pool is a trendy feature and is a great place to watch the sunset of Windhoek. The gym facilities overlook Windhoek and are good.  They organized cabs for us which were good value. There is a wide choice for breakfast. Would stay there again and would recommend as a good place to stay at the start/end of your Namibia trip.","Date of stay: February 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The roof top bar is a great place to unwind after a day at work - friendly and professional service and a great view.  I have stayed at other hotels in Windhoek on two previous occasions and was very disappointed with them.  I will stay at the Windhoek Hilton on future visits.","Date of stay: January 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Dubbio!","Questo hotel √® stato un buon punto di partenza e di arrivo per il mio viaggio in Namibia.L'arredamento √® molto carino ed elegante. La prima volta:Eravamo 3 persone in una stanza, e ci hanno giustamente fornito di due letti. Nella stanza non c'era il terzo asciugamano e nel letto non c'erano le fodere. La seconda volta:Siamo entrati in una stanza che a parer nostro non era stata ripulita, ma solo sistemata. L'asciugamano non era assieme all'altro pulito, ma era gi√† attaccato all'appendino della doccia ""Come se fosse stato usato e poi appoggiato l√¨"".Forse ho avuto suggestioni date dalla stanchezza.. O forse siamo solo stati sfortunati, per√≤ riporto le mie impressioni e quelle dei miei compagni! Per il resto, il ristorante dell'hotel √® buono.

"Nice place with views in the center of town ","We stayed two nights before starting out on our drive around the country. Windhoek itself is pretty low key with not much to do in town, but the Hilton had good service, a nice rooftop pool and cool Skybar with great views at sunset. Location is central, easy walk to shopping and local sites.We were celebrating our anniversary and the Hilton gave us some nice treats for the occasion. The only complaint we had is that when we went to the spa to get our complimentary  massages, the staff person  scheduled to do my husband's, was so late arriving that I was nearly finished and we had to leave, so he went without.Other than that, it was a very good stay.We are going back for our last night before leaving Namibia.","Date of stay: November 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Pleasantly surprised.","Before our two stays at the Windhoek Hilton in November 2014 I was concerned by some negative reviews that I had read on  Tripadvisor. I have  no reason for concern now. The hotel is a modern, sleek hotel that is worthy of the Hilton name. This was our first stay in a real hotel in Africa, and we were made to feel right at home. The staff was great. The restaurants were great and the room was great. A light bulb had burned out in the room, and that was our major complaint - completely inconsequential. I would be happy to stay there in future visits to Namibia. Keep up the good work.","Date of stay: November 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Verdient die ***** nicht.","Wir haben innerhalb von wenigen Wochen zweimal im Hilton Windhoek √ºbernachtet. Zuerst zwei und dann noch ein Nacht.Beim ersten mal hatten wir keine Badt√ºcher im Zimmer und es hat ziemlich lange gedauert bis wir welche bekamen. Damit unser schmutzige W√§sche abgeholt wurde haben wir am Morgen vor 7 Uhr angerufen. Am Mittag war der W√§schesack immer noch im Zimmer. Erst nach unserem dritten Anruf wurde dieser dann am Nachmittag abgeholt.An der Kommode waren zwei Schubladen nicht benutzbar.Bei unserem zweiten Besuch bekamen wir haben wir das Zimmer 400 bekommen obschon wir beim auschecken des ersten Aufenthaltes wieder das gleiche Zimmer 401 gebucht hatten.Zimmer 400 hatte einen extrem fleckigen Teppich das es einem grauste barfuss durch darauf zu laufen. Am Empfang hat man dies mit Bedauern zur Kenntnis genommen aber keine Alternative angeboten. Im Bad fehlten die kleinen Frotteet√ºcher. als wir diese zum zweiten mal beanstandet hatten bekamen wir dann noch einmal zwei gross.Am Abreisetag hat kurz nach 8  ein Angestellte (vermutlich vom House Keeping) an unsere Zimmert√ºre geklopft um zu Fragen um welche Zeit wir auschecken w√ºrden. Das haben wir noch nie erlebt. Das Personal am Empfang war sehr freundlich und der Portier hat uns erlaubt unser grosses Fahrzeug auf dem VIP-Parkplatz abzustellen, da es nicht in die Tiefgarage passte.Zur Zeit wird auf beiden Seiten des Hotels gebaut und in der Baugrube waren auch am Samstag schwere Baumaschienen am l√§rmen.","Date of stay: September 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great place to stay","I really enjoyed my room, fresh, clean and well designed. The shower had a double head, brilliant. And the second best smelling shower gel of any hotel I have stayed at (Movenpick Geneva has the best... :-) ). It is always great to have an iron and board in the cupboard as standard. Less great is wi-fi is free in the restaurants and in the foyer, but not in the rooms.... this is backwards! Parking was free, which is also a great touch in terms of service. What was not great was my lunch, Chicken was dreadful... and thereafter I decided to eat out. Service was not so great, I had to go to the counter to order a coffee, and then sat for 2 hours without a single waiter asking if I wanted anything. Overall I can still very much recommend staying here for trips to Windhoek.","Date of stay: November 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Service above and beyond","We stayed at the Hilton in Windhoek, Namibia and were very pleased.  The room was nice and  the breakfast buffet was lovely.  But we had the unfortunate experience of having my ATM card stolen at the bank down the street.  When we tried to call the International number on the back of the card there was no answer.  We had the same result the next day.  The woman at the concierge desk (and I am embarrased to say I don't know her name) got on her computer and found us a number in Canada who then found us a working number in the States and we were able to shut down the card. She spent the time to help us and placed the call at the hotel's expense.  She really couldn't have been more helpful and that kind of service is PRICELESS!","Date of stay: October 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Surprisingly good","I had been disappointed to find that due to overbooking, our tour operator had been unable to book us into the usual boutique hotel and had booked us into the Hilton. I feraed an anonymous international chain hotel. But in the event I found it delightful. The service was excellent. The room was large and well-appointed. The rooftop pool , while not big, enables you to swim proper lengths. Breakfast was absolutely excellent with a wonderful range of hot items, eggs cooked to order, smoothies and vegetable juices made to order and lovely baked goods. Service in the skybar was a bit haphazard with several bar staff hanging about aimlessly while people were waiting to be served but that is the only criticism. Front door staff and front desk staff were very helpful. It was a real pleasure to stay there.","Date of stay: October 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

On sent une r√©elle diff√©rence entre un petit h√¥tel tr√®s intime et attentionn√© et une grande chaine telle que le Hilton Windhoek qui n'en a presque rien √† faire du client. C'est tr√®s impersonnel. Niveau propret√©, c'est correct si on oublie le fait que la chambre n'est faite qu'une fois par jour et en milieu d'apr√®s midi. On se demande si le personnel est en nombre suffisant pour la structure.Le plus gros point noir est la foule de monde qui transite dans cette structure. A la piscine, difficile de se trouver une place. Cet espace dernier √©tage est envahi en fin de journ√©e. Avec la foule d'enfants qui hurlent dans l'eau, on se croirait √† la piscine municipale. Vraiment, cet h√¥tel manque d'intimit√©. En prime, je commande quelques cocktails en esp√©rant mieux √† chaque fois, ils √©taient tous plus immondes les uns que les autres. Ils devraient revoir leurs recettes de cocktails, je n'ai pas r√©ussi √† les boire.Nous aurions tant aim√© r√©server dans d'autres structures qui nous semblaient beaucoup plus attrayantes mais aucune n'avait de disponibilit√© sur les deux nuits (de week end) o√π nous avions pr√©vu de s√©journer sur Windhoek. Nous avions donc choisi le Hilton par d√©pit.","Date of stay: October 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sehr guter Ausgangspunkt einer Namibia-Reise","Wir verbrachten 1 Nacht im Hilton-Windhoek zur Beginn unserer Namibia-Reise. Ein tolles Hotel f√ºr den Anfang oder das Ende einer Namibia-Rundreise. Es liegt sehr zentral an der Einkaufsm√∂glichkeiten und die wenigen Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten, die Windhoek zu bieten hat, sind zu Fuss zu erreichen.Sehr aufmerksames Personal. Sehr zu empfehlen ist auch die Dachterasse mit Pool und Sky-Bar (tolle Aussicht!).Minuspunkte: W-LAN sehr teuer und man konnte am Wochenende kein Geld tauschen. Dies war erst Montag morgens wieder m√∂glich, als auch die gegen√ºberliegende Bank ge√∂ffnet hatte.","Date of stay: July 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Newly renovated","Hilton's always provide a good service and a generally good experience, but occasionally let you down via tired rooms. This was not the case in Windhoek. I am not sure when the renovations were done, but I would say in the last 12 months. Rooms were well sized and comfortable. Not if you are sharing a bed with a friend, note the bathroom is mostly glass and open to the bedroom, private enough, but you want to make sure they are a good friend!The pool deck/sky bar is a great place to watch the sun set over Windhoek, and if there is a sport game of note on, then the Kalabar is the place to be. I didn't try any of the restaurants, but they were busy whenever I went past, which is a good sign.","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Overlooking Windhoek","The new and very modern Hilton is right at the edge of Downtown Windhoek and offers a nice view, specially from the north facing rooms, as well as from the 9th floor rooftop with swimming pool and the Sky Bar, currently the talk of town and the place to be for busy after work and weekend Bar nights. Up here you can also find a Gym, Beauty Center and the Executive Lounge. Rooms:The rooms are large and in a modern open plan concept with plenty of storage and a seating area. The bathroom is half open to the room and offers a bathtub, shower and a wide wash dish area. The toilette is behind a separate door for some privacy. On the 1st floor you‚Äôll find a nicely appointed Restaurant with a open kitchen for Buffet style breakfast and lunch / dinners. Right next to it, there is also a indoor Bar on this floor.Parking:The Hilton has it‚Äôs own Parking Garage, accessible past the main entrance to the lower parking deck, large enough to fit also bigger 4√ó4 SUV‚Äôs.","Date of stay: February 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A nice Hilton property, excellent value for money on food","This was a good choice for three nights. The hotel is nicely decorated with tones of the country using stone and wood and well designed: the rooms are entirely separate from the reception and lobby area. Rooms are spacious and again much better decorated than most standard Hiltons with a nice (open to the room) bath area. The rooftop terrace is nice with a long but very thin pool so that exactly one person can do the laps. I felt the food in the restaurant for dinner was very good indeed and best value for fillet steak or wine. A nice feature in this ex-German colony are the cakes in the lobby. Service was very friendly and of a good standard. Hotel is in a central location so you can walk everywhere.","Date of stay: February 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Gewohnter Hiltonstandard","Hatten uns f√ºr das Hilton entschieden, da es zentral liegt und man alle Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten zu Fuss erreichen kann. Wir waren nur f√ºr 1 Nacht hier, es ist sehr zu empfehlen vor oder nach einer Rundreise. Das Hotel liegt an der Kreuzung zur Independence Avenue. Leider hat die zentrale Lage dann den Haken, dass es nicht unbedingt ruhig ist. Hatten einen Garden-Executive Room gebucht,  der ‚ÄúGarten‚Äù bestand aus 2 Palmen und ein bisschen Gr√ºn auf dem Balkon mit Aussicht zum Busparkplatz und grosser Baustelle! Gl√ºcklicherweise war es die Nacht von Samstag auf Sonntag, so dass wenigstens niemand auf der Baustelle gearbeitet hat. Das Hotel war aufgrund einer Tagung ausgebucht, die Rezeption war zeitweise nur mit 1 Person besetzt und diese hatte sehr viel zu tun, in der Lobby herrschte insgesamt ziehmliche Hektik und grosse Unruhe.  Auch war die Tiefgarage belegt, so dass wir auf den ‚Äúdrop-off‚Äù Pl√§tzen parken durften (es wurde uns auch keine Geb√ºhr in Rechnung gestellt).Das Zimmer war sehr ger√§umig, mit 2 grossen Fenster und Balkon, offenem Badezimmer, sep WC und Dusche. Grosses Bett und gen√ºgend Ablagefl√§che, allerdings dicke Teppichb√∂den! Obwohl Nichtraucherzimmer hatte offensichtlich unser Vorg√§nger im Zimmer geraucht. Da keine freien Zimmer zur Verf√ºgung standen, baten wir um Aufstellung eines Raumerfrischers ‚Äì allerdings wurde dies erst nach der 3. Aufforderung erledigt (housekeeping sei sehr besch√§ftigt)Die Executive Lounge ist sehr sch√∂n eingerichtet, befindet sich gegen√ºber des Schwimmbades und der dazugeh√∂renden Bar auf der Dachterrasse. Von hier hat man einen tollen Blick auf die Stadt. Zeitungen, Internet, Softdrinks gratis. Abends gab es kleine Snacks, alkoholische Getr√§nke wurden  nur bis 20 Uhr ausgeschenkt.Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet liess keinerlei W√ºnsche offen, sehr vielf√§ltig, grosses Angebot an warmen Speisen, sehr freundliches Personal.","Date of stay: October 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not what I was expecting","I was expecting the usual old chain hotel experience and was stunned by the beautiful, modern d√©cor.  The roof top bar did not disappoint nor did our accommodations.  We did have a problem with the room in that the shower drain must have been clogged because the room quickly flooded.  The staff was very friendly and cleaned up the room fairly quickly.  We were very tired and decided to eat early.  The only venue available to us was the bar.  The bar food was not bad but it was not very good either.  Perhaps the restaurants are better.  I would highly recommend this hotel if you have an early morning flight out.  The shuttle was spacious and the driver was extremely helpful.","Date of stay: July 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great place for Windhoek","After weeks of Safaris in tents, lodges and guest houses the Hilton was a nice end of our holidays. The hotel is good located directly at the Independence Avenue. During the day it's easily possible to walk around the several shops. The view from the window is great. It is probably the highest building around. Checking was good and fast, the staff was friendly. The room is nice and bright and has the equipment you expect from a 4-Star hotel. Certain things like bathrobe, slippers, shaving kit etc. were missing but everything else was good.  The kingsize bed was excellent and in good condition. We can recommend the dinner. The lady at the entrance was very friendly and the food was excellent. The value for what you get is extremly good! Also the breakfast buffet and the service was great.The Skybar invites for a drink over Windhoek and it is as well a place for relaxing at the (heated!) pool. The fitness center is small. However since I only use the treadmill it was ok for me. The only negative point was that they forgot to bring the baggage to the room even after a call to the reception. I finally had to go down to pick it up by myself.","Date of stay: August 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The Manager in the bar on the mezzanine floor across from the restaurant, think it was called Kalabar..","I enjoyed the Kalabar, the staff behind the bar was very helpful, and made great drinks, my only issue was the manager, I think his name was Joshua if I read his tag correct, colored fella with curly hair.  His staff was wonderful, and I really enjoyed myself until he came around scolding them and barking off questions and request with a very bad attitude as if he was perfect.  I'm a manager and a supervisor, but I'll never treat my staff the way he did in front of a paying customer, this occurred on both nights that I took in drinks at the bar during my stay. His staff was extremely professional, but he lacked professionalism. I've never seen a staff as polite as his staff, and treated the way he treated them.  Otherwise the Hilton is a great place to stay, and I stay there frequently on my business travel to Windhoek.","Date of stay: August 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Apparently no one knew this as we had to ask for everything. Plus when we did ask for the Internet password they gave us an hour at a time so when I got kicked off at 10pm, I had to call and someone had to run up a piece of paper to my room.

"Almost perfect but....","We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights after flying in from Johannesburg. We took a taxi from the Airport and paid ZAR 280 for 2 persons for the ride to the hotel.The hotel is of Hilton‚Äôs international standard, strategically located near the Independence Avenue, the centre of the city‚Äôs activities. There could not be a better location than this. We stayed on the 5th floor and our room was perfect, as can be seen from the photos we have posted here. We agree with all the previous reviews about the high standards of the room and the great views from the rooftop, so, we will not repeat them again. Our only complaint is against one of the staff, and unfortunately, we have to air our concerns here as there is no other forum for us to do, to ensure that this issue comes to the attention of the person in charge and not deleted and sent to ‚Äòtrash‚Äô should we address it as a general email to the hotel.On our final day at the hotel, we have asked the front desk staff by the name of Anna Massauwe, to assist us in booking a table at and a taxi to the famous Joe‚Äôs Beer House Restaurant. She assured us all will be arranged and we should just come down to the lobby at our appointed time in the evening and the taxi will be there for us. When we came down in the evening, we found out that she had booked for us a taxi to go to a restaurant called O Portuga instead!! We told her off for doing so and due to her doing, when we finally arrived at Joe‚Äôs without a booking, we had to wait for about an hour for a table and another 30 minutes for our food!! We are not sure whether this Ms Massauwe gets a commission for referring guests to O Portuga but for a hotel of Hilton‚Äôs standard, we did not expect this kind of behaviour from their staff! This was not a mere oversight and there was no language problem in our communication with her. We communicated with her in English, which she was fluent in, and ‚ÄúJoe‚Äôs Beer House‚Äù sounds VERY different from ‚ÄúO Portuga‚Äù. There could not be any mistake in that.We were not able to channel our complaint to the hotel‚Äôs management at that time as it was very late by the time we finally returned to the hotel and we had to check out early the following day. We hope the hotel will look into this serious misconduct of one of their staff so that incidents like this do not happen to other guests in the future. Other than this unfortunate incident, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel and will have no qualms in recommending it to other travellers.","Date of stay: March 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comfortable, modern hotel in central Windhoek","After a couple of weeks on the road in Namibia, we enjoyed this hotel a lot. Modern furnishings, comfortabe beds, good facilities and friendly and efficient staff all contributed to an enjoyable (if brief) stay. The hotel is right in the centre of town and within easy reach of restaurants, shops etc. They have a minibus to take guests to the airport but this was busy so they arranged a taxi for us.The only thing I didn't enjoy were the incredibly greedy guests in the executive lounge (some not many) who were intent in getting as much 'free' food and drink down their necks as quickly as possible.","Date of stay: October 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

New and modern building right in the heart of the city - within walking distance of all business appointments made. Friendly and pleasant staff at reception desk upon arrival. Was given complimentary Wifi for the duration of the stay - would otherwise be relatively expensive. Nice room with all the amenities one can expect. Great breakfast spread and again friendly staff. Haven't used the restaurant for lunch or dinner, but had the occasional beer and/or a snack in the late afternoon in the rooftop bar - very nice views from there.There was no information in the room about hotel services and facilities, as one would expect.If I had to return to Windhoek, I would choose this hotel again.","Date of stay: August 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Still a lot to learn","This hotel is still very new and looks great, the decor and design is the best in Windhoek but there are issues that come from being so new. The staff are nice and friendly but are not trained to the high standard you would expect from a Hilton hotel, here are a few examples:Hilton Honours - I'm a gold HH member and received no benefits nor an upgrade, the staff seemed pretty much unaware of its existence.Lots of things not working, water temperature in the shower goes really hot to cold and doesn't settle, Internet is intermittent and various services unavailable in the business center.Please do not be put off by my above comments as this hotel does have some good offerings such as the rooftop bar and pool although a serious lack of ashtrays. The executive lounge is nice for quiet drinks and the breakfast has a good selection. The main restaurant is really nice and has a great food but I found it was repeated too much, service in the restaurant was fast and efficient. For a bit of entertainment the Kalahari Sands hotel nearby has a casino, the streets seem safe enough to walk at night too.All in all this is a good hotel which over time will grow better with its staff.","Date of stay: January 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Great beds and bathtub.Service needs real improvements, three out of five felt sick after dinner in the hotel restaurant. Music from roof top bar is extremely loud until early morning.

"Chic style in Namibia?","If you are looking for an Africa experience, skip it. But it you want a true 4 star westernized-urban business-like hotel in downtown Windhoek then go for it. Did this whole place just drop into Namibia? Very lovely modern setting, room decoration is strange with bathtub open to the whole room. Roof top deck is fantastic, but small.  BEWARE of flaky wifi service that only works in some seats in the lobby, does not work in the rooms or roof top deck. Internet in the room is plug in...no plug on an iPad or smart phone so worthless for me. And they charge for internet access - annoying.","Date of stay: July 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very average stay - we expected more from a Hilton","We stayed at the Hilton Windhoek for one night at the end of our stay at the end of March 2022. We decided to stay here as we had given the car back and we wanted somewhere with amenities, including a restaurant (since we had heard it's not especially safe to walk around after dark), in the hotel. PROSThe room was spacious and had a pleasant view. There were also no bugs that we had experienced elsewhere on our trip! There was also good internet and a TV.There was a restaurant in the hotel, a rooftop pool and rooftop bar. Good location.The hotel helped us to chase our transfer to the airport the next day and the front entrance concierge were very helpful. CONSThere was no sauna/spa available still, we assume due to covid.The room service was terrible.. the first time we ordered, took over an hour to arrive and very average food. The second time we ordered, it took over an hour for half the order to arrive. We then had to chase the other half. After 20 minutes, nothing more arrived. We then had to call again and they finally got it right but it took another 15 minutes to come. The food, again, was very average.The food at the restaurant for dinner was below average but the wine was good (despite the first one we ordered having run out). The service was also below average. The same goes for breakfast for next day on quality and service fronts.The rooftop bar was a good cider but they got the order wrong in terms of giving us glasses with ice.In summary, the hotel was below average for what was paid and we expected at least an average service with a Hilton.","Date of stay: March 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Windhoek Hilton","Lack of a general manager has led to a massive drop in quality of service and care. Food is dreadful, except the pizza, breakfast pathetic. Staff uncaring and rude. Just not worth the price. Coffee in the restartuant 4xthe price of Zenzi shop which is much better quality over the road in the mall. Guests expected to pay to park a car even if you have high frequency status. Loyalty not recognised nor cared about. Security intrusive and rude clearly do not care","Date of stay: February 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good location, nice service","Very nice hotel with helpful staff. We had a standard room, which was comfortable in size, but had one major minus: no wall between the room and the bathroom! As a Finn I‚Äôm totally OK with nudity in the sauna and going skinny dipping in a lake, but I definitely want my privacy in the bath! No to recommend. Otherwise accommodations were good and the bed comfortable. The hotel has a rooftop bar, swimming pool, gym and spa. The skybar is great for sunset drinks.We only had breakfast at the hotel, but there is both a restaurant and a wine bar. Breakfast was tasty and very comprehensive.The hotel is located very near major sites like the Independence Memorial and the Parliament.","Date of stay: January 2020This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Poor Standards ","This is my second stay at the Hilton in the last 2 months and I must admit the service   is getting worse. The water heating was not working and I had to take cold showers. Despite my compliant no one was interested to fix it. The shower is also blocked and keeps flooding the bathroom floor.Every request is hard work and they need to take a note for someone else to do. Simplest thing like sending me the invoices by email was a struggle. I needed change for 100 dollar note and guess what .. they don‚Äôt have change and no one bothered to help. Last night in the roof bar, I noticed the staff washing the glasses by hands only. I am a Hilton member and this is the worst  Hilton I ever stayed in.I was polite to raise all my concerns to the manager and I hope someone will take actions very soon.","Date of stay: January 2020This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Brilliant from A - Z","I had a fantastic experience at this hotel, starting with a very friendly driver who picked me up from the airport and whose name I have sadly forgotten. Friendly and efficient check-in, nice room, very clean and tidy. Great breakfast. Beautiful roof-top pool (sadly not heated during my visit). Sauna and Spa closed for refurbishment. Very approachable GM whom I met when he inspected the gym and surrounding areas. I look forward to staying here again.","Date of stay: June 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great hotel for stopover.","Perfect place for a couple of night stopover. Rooms were big, place was perfectly clean, staff were very friendly (without exception). Sky bar was great. Executive Club was pretty small with limited choices at breakfast. Saw a few arrive then leave for the main buffet restaurant.  Good, safe location. Not much to do in Windhoek so will probably not be back but would stay here again if we did.","Date of stay: February 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I am so disappointed by Hilton. what a shame!","I booked a room at Hilton well in advance (1 year before) and I just made a mistake with my computer to book it (april 29th instead of 28th 2017). I tried to change it immediately, 2 minutes after. Impossible. I tried to call them 4 times + 2 emails without any answer. After a last e-mail, Hilton answered me that nothing is possible without proposing a solution. I am very very disappointed by this so poor service and understanding. Even with low cost companies like easyjet, it is possible to modifiy within 24 hours. That why I don't recommand at all to book Hilton, it is not a luxury hotel, providing services and comfort. I will choose another and better hotel than Hilton for my stay in Windhoek.","Date of stay: January 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great Stay","I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights while in Windhoek for work. The hotel is very nice, if a bit pricey.The pros: the location is great, right in the center of Widhoek and about a 25-30 minute drive from the airport. The WiFi was slow occasionally, but mostly worked well. There is a gorgeous rooftop pool and bar, which offers great views and is a good place to hang out after a long day. The breakfast in the restaurant is pretty good, nothing out of the ordinary but still a great way to start the day. The gym is small, but it has enough equipment to get a decent workout in.The rooms themselves are nice, clean and spacious. The same is true for the bathrooms. The bed is very comfortable.The only cons I experienced in my time there were that there are only 3 elevators, so you can wait a few minutes until one is available (particularly if one is out, as was the case for part of my stay). There was a line when I was checking in, so that took a little while, but the service from staff was otherwise great. The restaurant was good for breakfast, but only okay otherwise. There are a lot of other fantastic restaurants nearby, so I might suggest exploring those during your time in Windhoek. The hotel was a bit pricey, but to be expected for a hotel this nice.The cons are all minor, however, and I definitely would stay here again during my next trip to Windhoek. I would also recommend this hotel to anyone going!","Date of stay: September 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"No room at the inn","We booked and paid 2 weeks ago and on arrival are booted out for a group. Happens fairly often according to receptionist. Completely unacceptable. We are in a foreign country without a hotel room. Their solution is a room in A hotel 20km out if town. Flabbergasted that a Hilton can do this.","Date of stay: February 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Probably the best option in Windhoek","Really nice modern hotel, though I've spent lots of time in Africa and my expectations are moderated therefore -those who have only spent time in SE Asia, US and Europe may be less impressed!  It's a nicely designed and striking building right in the heart of this small and pleasant city.  You can walk to shops, cafes etc which seems perfectly safe in the daytime at least.  The hotel must be only a couple of years old, though showing some signs of wear (pool tiles, crack on side of bath, stained room carpet) already so they need to keep up to speed on maintenance to stop the slide.  Staff are nice and professional.  Room was big, modern and very comfortable.  Breakfast was one of the best I've had anywhere.  Extras were not expensive, eg a coffee and huge slice of cake on the outside terrace for about ¬£4.50.  My Hilton gold card gave me 'free' internet and access to the lounge for usual drinks and snacks -without this it would have been less good value.  I visited a few other WIndhoek hotels, this seemed the best by some margin.","Date of stay: November 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Worst customer care experience","I advance booked for transport to and from the airport. They say check-in is 3 pm but I was made to wait for 2 hours as rooms were not ready. When we were given our keys at 530pm we were told to to our rooms as our bags will immediately follow. The porter wrote our room numbers on his hands and forgot to bring them. I had to call front desk after an hour and our bags finally came and the porter never even apologised. Seing that the hotel seems to be sleeping on the job, I made sure I had to verify the night before that I will be picked up at 6am on my checkout as booked. To my surprise I was only booked for pick-up and they had ommited to capture that I need to be dropped off! They then amended and said it's now fine your shuttle will be waiting for you at 6. Surprise the following morning,  no shuttle for my family of 4, no shuttle for another family of 3 and no shuttle for an individual lady, all leaving at 6am. After about 15 minutes delay all guests were agitated and asking the front desk guy who kept saying it will be sorted, we were now literally shouting at him and he just stood there helpless after phoning Hertz. The shuttle came at around 620 and we all fought to get in it was messy. The Hertz driver (Innocent) was at least helpful and called for another shuttle, trying to save the situation created by the hotel. We were rushed to the airport in dead silence as everyone was angry. As we were late, we had to rush through departure formalities breathlessly and in the commotion I lost my travel neck pillow! This was my worst experience at any hotel and Hilton Windhoek needs to improve their customer care and logistical arrangements so as not to tarnish the Hilton brand.","Date of stay: December 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"""Faulty Towers"" in Namibia","Booked two King Hilton Deluxe Rooms and paid in advance. Received an e-mail confirmation regarding both booking stipulating check-in time is at 14:00. We arrived at 17:40 and was informed that the rooms were not ready? Were offered two standard rooms ( a downgrade) by Victor but with lounge access if we would like to check in as it could be a while before the deluxe rooms would be ready. Accepted the option to check in immediately as it was then nearly 18:00.No welcome letter or water or any recognition for a loyal Hilton Honours member in the room. Room was in a poor condition. Seem that someone was on the bed after the room was made up. The telephone did not work, the fridge door did not have a handle and the desktop light was broken. Informed the front desk and maintenance suggested a room change after their inspection. Eventually received a King Hilton Deluxe room that I booked at 21:00. At 21:20 someone else attempted to get access to the room. This person was also booked in the same room.Executive lounge very small and not on the same level as the lounges as other Hilton Hotels. Very limited food and drinks offering. The attendant also does not replenish wines when it is finish. A group of young tourist quickly finished the only two bottles of red wine that were put out and it was never replenished.  When my room was  changed at 21:00 people were still checking in and were told about their lounge access and directed towards the lounge, but everything in the lounge gets packed away at 20:00. What a joke. It seems that the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing! Can just imagine what breakfast will be like tomorrow morning. Will definitely not stay here again. Overprized, unorganised and just plain pathetic service! This hotel is a blemish on the Hilton name.","Date of stay: February 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Inutile d'y chercher le s√®che cheveux puisqu'il est rang√© dans l'un des tiroirs du bureau de la chambre . Cette derni√®re est √©quip√©e d'un √©cran plat et de wifi ( payante) .Le ""Skybar"" situ√© sur le toit, autour de la piscine, est agr√©able mais comme il faisait froid on a pr√©f√©r√© boire un verre au ""Kalabar"" situ√© sur la mezzanine et o√π les profonds fauteuils de cuir sont confortables .On a mang√© au restaurant l'Ekipa o√π un buffet, copieux et vari√© nous a donn√© le choix entre diff√©rentes salades et crudit√©s, des grillades de poissons ou de viande ( l'agneau √©tait excellent ) et de bons desserts comme, par exemple, des morceaux de banane enrob√©s de chocolat craquant .Le petit d√©jeuner, servi lui aussi √† l'√âkipa, se pr√©sente sous forme d'un buffet avec fruits frais ( ananas, raisins, fruits de la passion ) , ≈ìufs ( durs ou omelettes), charcuteries (saucisses, jambon, bacon etc.), pains, c√©r√©ales et yaourts . On peut aussi go√ªter √† la semoule collante de ma√Øs ( pap) qui est l'un des plats de base de la cuisine namibienne .Nous n'avons eu aucun probl√®me de service, ni au bar, ni au restaurant, ni √† la r√©ception .

"Theft in Windhoek Hilton","I had a very unfortunate experience in Hilton Windhoek:  I left my travel wallet including my passport and travel money in the hotel safe (Room number 317 to be exact) and departed for Erongo Wilderness Lodge.  Upon arrival in the Lodge, I found out about the mishap and immediately contacted my travel agent.  I was informed that the wallet was found and it was returned to me on the way to the next destination.  Unfortunately 200 USD was missing from my wallet although there was cash remaining.  I immediately informed the travel agent who confirmed that they had received the amount I had found when the wallet was returned.  The travel agent later informed me that she had watched the security footage at the time the wallet was handed over to the hotel management and everything looked in order.  Naturally there was no footage from the time the wallet was collected from the safe.  Therefore, whatever happened in the interim remains unknown.  Although hotel management acknowledged the situation they claimed they could do nothing.  I try to understand this from their perspective (whose word against who).  On the other hand, as a guest who has spent a significant amount of money on this travel, I would not be in a position to lie about 200 USD and the hotel management should be able to empathize with this fact.I am writing this review, as this incident may happen to other guests and hurt people on a larger scale.  I think it is super important to take these feedback from your guests to dive deeper into the problem and avoid any future issues.  Regarding other amenities in the hotel, all was in order and I do not have anything else to complain about.  Especially the breakfast staff was very hospitable and kind.  The breakfast and specifically fresh juices were amazing.","Date of stay: August 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

When I insisted to see somebody from the management, they sent the IT manager who apologized but did not come up with an adequate proposal for compensation.He told me they would come back to me with a proposal for a compensation and would take a certain part of the charge of the other hotel.Nothing happened: no message, no apologies.Stay away from this hotel. Their policy is overbooking and the competition in Windhoek allows them to do so...","Date of stay: June 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Das Hotel bietet f√ºr nur 350 Namibian Dollar einen Airport Transfer zum Flughafen an was genauso viel kostet wie ein Taxi, aber daf√ºr f√§hrt man in einen neuen komfortablen Hertz Limousine und wird man nicht vom Taxifahrer abgezockt.","Date of stay: December 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Trotz gravierender Servicem√§ngel besseres Hotel im Herzen von Windhoek ","Das Hilton war unsere letzte Unterkunft nach einer 3 w√∂chigen Rundreise durch Namibia vor dem R√ºckflug. Aufgrund des Namens und der 5 Sterne Klassifizierung und des damit verbundenen Preises waren unsere Erwartungen entsprechend hoch. Sie konnten aber nur teilweise erf√ºllt werden. Der Check in verlief schleppend und war von leichter Arroganz gepr√§gt. Gut war aber, dass man das ansonsten teure kostenpflichtige WLAN im Zimmer dadurch ""geschenkt"" bekam in dem man Mitglied des Hilton Programms wurde. Man machte uns klar, dass wir ja nur (!) ein Standardzimmer gebucht h√§tten und dass man f√ºr das Kind noch ein Zustellbett in das Zimmer stellen m√ºsse ( Hinweis: das war in der Buchung mit 2 E und 1 K bereits angegeben). Obwohl das Housekeeping gleich informiert wurde, war auch 5 h nach dem Einchecken immer noch keines gestellt. Unser Hinweis an die Schokolade verteilende Mitarbeiterin wurde insoweit Rechnung getragen, dass wir nach dem Abendessen vor(!!!!) unserem Zimmer das (  nicht bezogene ) Zustellbett vorfanden. Es ist unseres Erachtens ein Unding, dass man in einem 5 Sterne Hotel der Hilton Kette ein Zustellbett selbst reinrollen, M√∂bel verr√ºcken und das Bett selbst beziehen muss. Das ansprechende Zimmer selbst war im 8. Stock belegen und bot eine sch√∂ne Sicht √ºber Windhoek. An der Sauberkeit gab es nichts auszusetzen. Was aber auffiel war, dass trotz der 3-er Belegung nur ein Bademantel im Schrank hing. Eine Etage h√∂her auf dem Dach war das Highlight des Hotels, der nette gut temperierte Infinitypool mit der Skybar. Kleines Manko hier: nirgendwo war ein Hinweis wie man an die Poolhandt√ºcher kommt. Die Bar war mit einer Servicekraft auch unterbesetzt. Das dort angebotene Essen (Burger, Pizza, Sandwich und √§hnliches) war preislich und geschmacklich in Ordnung. Der von dort gebotene Blick √ºber Windhoek war etwas getr√ºbt durch  die Gro√übaustelle direkt vor dem Hotel, was man dem Hilton aber nat√ºrlich nicht anlasten kann.Das Themenabendessen im Restaurant des Hotels - war ein Buffett - (Tintenfisch, W√ºrstchen und Steaks wurden a la minute zubereitet), welches in (!) der K√ºche aufgebaut war. Es war nicht √ºberragend, aber ordentlich, der Service war vergleichbar. Preislich war es noch in Ordnung.Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war umfangreich und schmackhaft, es fehlte aber der letzte Kick, was aus einem guten Fr√ºhst√ºck ein sehr gutes macht. Positiv zu nennen sind die frisch gepressten S√§fte auf Wunsch. Der Check out verlief unproblematisch, Bordkarten wurden anstandslos und kostenfrei gedruckt. Die Hotelgarage war zwar kostenpflichtig, aber preiswert. Aber auch am Abreisetag mussten wir auf die Gep√§ckabholung 15 min warten. Fazit: der sch√∂ne Pool und das akzeptable Zimmer machen Servicem√§ngel nur teilweise wett. Von einem Hotel der Hiltongruppe sollte man mehr erwarten d√ºrfen. Zu empfehlen sind Zimmer in den h√∂hergelegenen Etagen.","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"EXPERIENCE WITH HILTON","highly disappointed with Hilton Windhoek, despite my effort to ensure that our shuttle was booked and availed on time, we still had problems on the day of arrival and departure. The hotel was not clean to my satisfaction, i spent the whole week in Hilton and my bedding was never changed, the water spills were left to dry and never wiped, i left the room when they were still there, which was evidence that the cleaners are not thorough with their job.","Date of stay: July 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Well situated and comfortable ","The Hilton in Windhoek is very well situated in the city with easy access to Parliament gardens and the Christuskirche. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and attentive. The SkyBar on the 9th floor has amazing views over the city and to the mountains beyond. Very nice for sunsets. The executive lounge is also nice and Vivien and Willard were great hosts. They will easily help with reservations at restaurants and the concierge downstairs also can arrange transport to restaurants. Just be sure to agree pricing ahead of time.","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Auf der Dachterrasse vom Schreck erholt","Das Hotel liegt im Stadtzentrum und vieles l√§sst sich gut zu Fu√ü erreichen. Wir hatten das Pech, dass wir 150 Meter vorm Hotel f√ºr zwei R√§uber interessant wurden (das geh√∂rt auch zur Innenstadt), da sa√üen wir noch im Auto. Deshalb unser Rat:immer Zentralverriegelung! Wir hatten sie n√§mlich nicht benutzt und schwupps war die Tasche vom R√ºcksitz weg. Allerdings war ich auch - schwupps - vom Beifahrersitz abgeschnallt, stand gleich hinter dem R√§uber und habe sehr mit ihm geschimpft . Daraufhin lie√ü er die Tasche fallen. So etwas kann man in Namibia wagen, niemals in S√ºdafrika (da dort die √úberf√§lle viel gewaltt√§tiger sind, und man schnell ein Messer am Hals haben kann). Insofern gab es ein glimpfliches Ende, der R√§uber war erschrocken, ich irgendwie auch. Wir fuhren ins Hotel (sehr sch√∂ne, saubere Zimmer) und dann auf die gro√üz√ºgige Dachterrasse. Dort k√ºhlte ich mich im Pool ab, nahm auf den Schreck einen Sundowner und war sofort mit der guten Aussicht und dem tolle Ambiente vers√∂hnt. Nein, der kleine Bandit hat uns die Laune nicht verdorben. Aber die Standpauke, die hat er verdient :)","Date of stay: January 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not a Five star.","Well this is definitely not a Five star hotel and as such is overpriced. The hotel fist impression good and modern but when you look closer one can see it is already pretty worn down for the years it is in service. Tidiness of our room was on average level. Staff was friendly and helpful but not of 5 star standard. Construction work all around the hotel these days so a bit noisy.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton Windhoek, Namibia stay","This is a great hotel in a very convenient location. Easy to find if driving in from the airport. Staff very accommodating. Its hard to think of a bad word to say in fact I cannot think of one. I will stay there on my next trip to Namibia. The roof pool and bar are a great asset.","Date of stay: June 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I like it","Overall probably best place in Windhoek - but service can be patchy.First room we had was East facing which was above the Hotel Casino - a muffled thumping sound of music until 5.30am can be heard in the room. We changed to another room because this room also had a glass panel cracked. Restaurants and bar service is patchy - some good some bad. Have found this throughout Namibia, however a little in-house training by Hilton would improve. At the sky bar for example, I ask for 2 drinks and a dessert. After a long time i enquire what's happening & the girl had forgot. Then proceeded to also forget the dessert. In the Executive Lounge they ran out of Gin early in evening and would not get replacements - surly girl on duty at time. But every time something was not right and you got a manager involved these issues were resolved quickly - so for that reason I can be forgiving. I still liked the great location and the pool area. It's good value I think and food and drink prices are good. I would go back.","Date of stay: March 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Roof top swimming pool leaking. Potential danger to guests and staff","Whilst the hotel is nice I would not stay again due to the danger of the ceiling collapsing on the 9th floor due to the roof top swimming pool leaking. So much so that it has damaged the marble flooring on the 5th Floor. My worry is that it will eventually collapse. I believe that this is a potential danger to life.","Date of stay: January 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"What a mess - standards have slipped terribly!","I have always supported this hotel as the service was always friendly and efficient.  This time around was a absolute mess and it was as if all the staff have been replaced with people who are not properly trained.  The check in took about 50 minutes and then they managed to get the room allocations all wrong as well.  The check out was just such a mess as a result of the incorrect name allocations to rooms.  The bed in the room didn't have pillowcases on half of the pillows.  The bar fridge didn't contain water but had fruit juice and alcohol.","Date of stay: September 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great Location, Good Facilities, Poor Service","Stayed here in July 2015 with family.The overwhelming vibe entering the building is of a new property...which is a good thing, as things may not have had time to wear/tear/breakdown. I really liked the facilities as I came in.The front desk staff were efficient and got us checked in quickly...as was the bellman who brought up our bags. The room itself was quite standard, but again decent build quality and good modern decor. The room did face a construction site, which I was not informed about while checking in...poor service. The hotel did appear to be running at less than full capacity so we would have appreciate an option of the other side.The best part about the hotel is the location. I think anyone with business in Windhoek would find it extremely convenient. It's barely a kilometer to any big office space or the Parliament Building for that matter. Among the facilities the Pool and Skybar are really good options to relax at. The pool was especially welcome as it was heated up, which our kid loved in the cold weather. The main restaurant Ekipa and the Skybar are well set up but I found that the staff were unable to help with any request that didn't involve ordering directly off the menu. Now this isn't a deal breaker but sometimes one is looking for something extra. This was decidedly missing.The concierge was also unhelpful with a couple of basic requests...some things  that any 2-star hotel operator (not even a concierge) should have a handle on....I won't bore with details. Overall it points to a lack of training beyond the minimum or basic level. I really expect more from a global brand like Hilton. We got much better service at the small boutique hotel Olive Exclusive across town...and they barely get as much exposure to so many visitors given their size.I think this hotel makes sense if you are looking for a ""known"" quantity while out on a short business trip and don't anticipate having any sort of ""off the menu"" requests. Else watch out...cause they will not be able to help.","Date of stay: July 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Average Hilton value, pricy","Stayed one night on business. The rooftop pool and bar made it all worth it. Sunset and the slow emergence of an incredibly starred sky - entirely cloudless this time of the year - what an experience. The pool is the width of a single lane in a regular pool but this does not lower its appeal, and exercise swimming is possible, which is not the case in other 'rooftop pools' in town. Great views of the city. Otherwise average Hilton experience, nothing impressive but expensive compared to other local accomodation.","Date of stay: May 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Confortable, but not the service expected from a Hilton","We got to the hotel at 9 pm on a Sunday. They received us very well, but when we got to the room, the mini bar had nothing on it. After traveling a lot, I was very thirsty, so asked to bring bottled water to the room while we went to the rooftop to drink some cocktails. First surprise: the bar was closing, and the girl wouldn't take any orders. When we went back to the room, our water hadn't arrived. I had to call 3 times in order to have something to drink. Breakfast was good, with lots of choices. Then, for lunch we went to the other restaurant-bar and ordered some sandwiches... almost an hour until they got to our table. Conclusion: nice hotel, confortable, but awful service. Bring a lot of patience and extra time, if not, you're gonna have a bad time here.","Date of stay: January 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A bit disappointing","I stayed for three nights on a business trip.  At first glance the hotel is very impressive, however from the moment we stepped into the building it went downhill.  I was booked into a room with bath and shower however I was allocated a wheelchair friendly room with only a shower.  When I realised the mistake I immediately went to reception where I was told it was my fault as I should have checked when I was checked in (!).  I was then told they are fully booked and that was that.  There was no porters to assist myself and my colleague with our luggage - we had to carry all our bags by ourselves. One plus point is the rooms - they are very comfortable. The restaurant choices are very limited, especially if you are staying for more than 1 night.  At breakfast there was no option for continental, thus we had to pay for a full English breakfast although we only had cold meat. The hotel does not live up to the reputation of what one would expect of a Hilton.","Date of stay: September 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"10 out of 10","Expectations were met from all angles - room, entertainment, service and food quality all top notch. We checked in rather late on a Wednesday evening and the check in took literally 3 minutes where after we got to our rooms and were still able to have a meal in the bar area whilst watching one of the world cup games. Breakfast was outstanding with a massive quality selection to choose from. Sky Bar at sunset was again a special experience so all in all a great stay.","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Normal...","Stayed here the 2nd time, booked in advance , yet prices are too steep for Windhoek , however it is the hilton so let's move ahead cuz of the brand. Smoking rooms available for now, bear in mind smoking in public places in the city of Windhoek is a big no no.. U can't even smoke in the open air and the Hilton Windhoek has it's share of confusion, smokers can only use the sky bar or the ground floor terrace , no smoking on the mezzanine bar which also has its own open air terrace, although we saw 3 people lighting up they were only told once they completed their cigars.. Hence we were confused. Breakfast as usual is a big spread, bear in mind this hotel is known for assigning rooms which are already being used , no clue why, it's the 2nd time it happened to us plus someone else @ breakfast had a similar story...so pardon the intrusion..","Date of stay: May 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappointing business trip","Check in was great.  Aubry was warm, professional and exceeded my expectation when providing assistance with check-in, internet access, etc.  I enjoyed the Roof Top bar and the lounge/bar on first floor. (Service is poor in both areas.  Thankfully, I was relaxed and did not have high expectation). My dinner at first floor lounge/bar was yummy.  Disappointments.  - Noise in room. A guest in an adjacent room made a phone call in the foyer. I heard every word - the walls and doors are not thin. - Room service. I contacted House Keeping, Room Service and the Reception Desk for a bottle opener. I wanted to enjoy a drink from the mini bar but needed an opener. 30 minutes and several phone calls before I received bottle opener and then he wanted a tip. - I asked the Concierge to assist with a dinner reservation. They forgot. No reservation was made. - At check-out, my bill for the business meeting was ambiguous (staff struggled to discern bill) and included several errors.  They argued amongst themselves and argued with me.  It was a poor end to the trip.","Date of stay: December 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very international flair","We stayed at the Hilton on our first day, after having just travelled all the way from London. The hotel was easy to find and is straight on the way from the airport. Check in was very efficient. The room was very spacious with a nice big bathroom space. It also had a fantastic view over the city centre and the big church. We then made our way upstairs to the roof top bar which was a really nice place to relax after a long flight. We later on used the bar on the first floor which had very attentive staff. In the morning I panicked a bit as I genuinely thought I had lost my wallet and thought I had maybe dropped it in the bar. Staff at reception were extremely helpful trying to find it and soon I had about 4 people looking for it everywhere, only to then realise that it had fallen behind the desk in our room. Breakfast was also a very pleasant affair which had everything you need. I am especially a fan of made to order omelettes and I wasn't disappointed. The only con I could think of was, that being a Hilton, this hotel could have easily been anywhere in the world and was lacking a bit of local charm.","Date of stay: June 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sensational","The only place to stay in delightful Windhoek. Across all aspects of the stay, this is an exquisite hotel, and worth splurging on at the beginning or end of your trip to Namibia (the prices are still very competitive). The design of the building, the size and quality of the rooms, the dining experience and not least the hospitality and professionalism of the staff all add up to make this hotel a compulsory one on your Namibian itinerary. The Sky Bar is a real hit! If you're desperate to escape the nanny states of Australia, Europe and North America, come and relax here - you can have a cocktail and cigarette in peace!","Date of stay: January 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good but has significant flaws","Room in tower very pleasant. Large, quiet and nicely designed. However.....on getting to room bedside light was wrecked, phone did not work (both not plugged in and not correctly programmed) and bath water a very interesting brown colour (also stained carpet - not acceptable in hotel with these pretensions). To their credit the staff cleared these problems (with exception of stains) very quickly.9th Floor bar very pleasant and breakfast above average.After 2 days of 4 day stay I was sent a letter by management stating that my credit had run out and that I should make an immediate payment - despite having given my credit card details and the booking having been made for 4 days through travel company. I had an exchange of views with the front desk staff, who said I would receive a comment from the manager (he/she was not available for a direct discussion). Still not got it!The staff were very friendly and welcoming - but I got the feeling that the management of this hotel should be far more proactive and be more hands-on themselves. Maybe they could do with some training.A further pet-hate - paying large sums for the slowest internet in the world.","Date of stay: October 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I changed to the executive room and that was nice, would suggest though that you improve your booking system and redo the diplo suite.- Better service at sky bar during busy periods is needed.Overall, a solid city hotel, I‚Äôd recommend it but maybe advise you to make your dining plans elsewhere‚Ä¶","Date of stay: November 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Super entt√§uscht","Seid vielen Jahren fahren wir ins Hilton vor unserem R√ºckflug und haben diesen letzten Tag immer sehr genossen auf der Dachterrasse. Dieses Jahr allerdings nicht. Die Terrasse war belagert von jungen Einheimischen samt fragw√ºrdigen Damen, dass fast kein Platz mehr f√ºr G√§ste war. Der Service war √ºberirdisch schlecht - ich wei√ü nicht, wer hinter der Theke stand, aber es war sicher kein ausgebildetes Personal. Es dauerte 30 Minuten (bei 4 G√§sten) allein die Bestellung aufzugeben, Bier war dann schon wieder abgestanden, Cocktail wurde nicht geschafft trotz nachlesen in der Karte, Essen dauerte 1 1/2 Stunden.........ich habe super viel Verst√§ndnis f√ºr coronabedingte Engp√§sse - aber wir zahlen viel Geld f√ºr diese Unterkunft und das war unvorstellbar schlecht. Rezeption kaum besetzt, Restaurant war mit 5 Personen zum Dinner komplett √ºberfordert, Wein zu bekommen sehr schwierig, entweder nicht da oder kochend heiss, Essen h√§tte ein 12j√§hriger besser gekocht. Wir waren in jedem Restaurant tief im Busch in Namibia besser versorgt. Die Nudelsosse war mit Ketchup pfui Teufel. Also da muss das Hilton jetzt unverz√ºglich was √§ndern, sonst k√∂nnen die nach Corona schlie√üen, weil sie sich alle G√§ste vergrault haben.","Date of stay: November 2020This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Premium hotel in Windhoek","After a very long flight from the states, we always look for a reliable option to recoup and catch up on our sleep to get on the new time zone.  This hotel serves its purpose for us without being the most luxurious Hilton we've seen before.  The common areas are very premium looking but the rooms are average.  They are clean and definitely comfortable but they have a funny open bathroom format that has the shower only a few feet from the bed.  The morning breakfast buffet is plentiful and our a la carte dinner was fine too.  There is a lovely rooftop pool and bar area that is a nice way to end the day.  Workout run is on the top floor with a panoramic view of the city.  There is a mall walking distance from the hotel so if you need anything before going 'into the bush' on safari, you can easily find it.  There's not much to check out relative to sightseeing - it really is simply a springboard for seeing the country or doing business in this city.","Date of stay: August 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Centrale, comodo, accogliente!","La scelta dell'hotel Hilton di Windhoeck  l'ho fatta dopo il suggerimento di una amica. Ho guardato la location e le foto dell'hotel e mi sono convinto che questa sarebbe stata una buona scelta per me e per i miei amici (eravamo 3 coppie, a me √© stato delegato il compito di provvedere a tutto). √à stata un'ottima scelta, facile da raggiungere provenendo dall'aeroporto, La struttura ha un comodo garage sotterraneo dove parcheggiare la macchina. Servizi molto efficienti, camere molto gradevoli ed ampie e un comodo letto. La colazione √© molto buona e offre qualcosa che non mi era mai capitato finora, ottimi smooties che vengono preparati al momento (io viaggio spesso per lavoro).  Decisamente una buona scelta!","Date of stay: June 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Excellent hotel with room for improvement","This review would have been 5* if not for the bad start to my stay. I had booked to be collected at the airport and confirmed this again a few days before my arrival. I received email confirmation that I would be collected, however nobody turned up to collect me. This is not acceptable, especially for a hotel of this standard. There is nothing worse for a traveller arriving in a new country to have no one to meet them. It transpired a car had been booked to collect me from the airport on the day I left. Not good enough and the procedure needs reviewing.Shortly after arriving a member of staff brought to my room a welcome card and a bowl of nuts, dried fruit and billtong. This was a lovely touch, unfortunately the welcome card was addressed to another guest. A minor detail of course, but minor details are important to guests.Apart from the bad start the rest of my stay was excellent. I stayed in a tower room, which was very large, spotlessly clean and beautifully appointed. Room service was very prompt. Breakfast is of a very high standard with a huge variety of choice, but should be included in the room rate. All the staff I spoke to were friendly, welcoming and helpful. A real asset to the hotel. The top floor roof terrace is super with a small pool and lovely bar area. The hotels location is very convenient. Just a short walk to the famous church and the independence memorial and museum. A little further up hill, but quite walkable is the botanical gardens which are well worth a visit.This is a quality hotel with great staff and I will definitely stay here again when I am in Windhoek.","Date of stay: May 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not really worth the money ","I feel like I expected more from a Hilton Hotel. The first negative was we waited 1.5hours before we could go to our rooms. While I understand we arrived at 1:30pm and check in time is only at 2:00pm, we still waited a whole hour after we should have been able to check in before we got to go to our rooms. The second negative was that there was no free WiFi to guests in their rooms. You have to pay for it. Their third negative was that we were told the the spa closed at 6pm when we tried to make a booking, yet it is advertised in the book in the hotel room and the door outside the spa that they close at 10pm.Sky bar is pretty and has an amazing view, but it gets full very fast. So if you want a table, go a bit earlier. Their breakfast I will say was amazing! They had such a wide spread and the chefs/kitchen staff are very helpful and accommodating towards anyone with food allergies or certain food requirements. The rooms are nice and clean and had everything I needed. The double bed bathroom situation is weird as you can see the other person if they in the shower or bathing (I shared with my siblings). It‚Äôs nice, but just a bit awkward if you‚Äôre not a couple.","Date of stay: December 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappointed","Following standards of Hilton hotels we choose Hilton Windhoek after our Namibian road trip.Apart from very unprofessional front office staff, that offered us downgrade just because at 4p.m. they still didn't manage to prepare our room for arrival. Then room maid that was caught while during turndown she was checking our bags and the worst culinary experience in 8 african countires I was able so far to visit, but this is a separate depressing story. Like when puring myself juice for breakfast waitress came to ask if she can have it because one of the guests ordered it. I know Windhoek offers very limited choice of accomodation, but I'm sure a bit more research can make you happier.For sure not Hilton Winhoek.Service questionable, tv worked very poor, restaurant bad quality, steam room very very dirty, taxi drivers addicted to cell phone. Too many things to question. Pitty","Date of stay: May 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Reliable Full Amenities Hotel in Downtown Windhoek","It was nice to have my own queen bed for a night on a trip I'd been sharing with a friend. The room was spacious. There was a GORGEOUS tub, but unless we kicked the other out there was no door to allow privacy. My problem with the hotel was that when we checked in, the front desk woman asked if she could upgrade us, which would mean access to the lounge for drinks and breakfast. Of course we said yes. The next morning when we went to get our breakfast, though, the woman at the lounge told us we weren't upgraded. If we had known that, we would have accounted for it in our timeline and planned around having to get breakfast somewhere else. Ultimately, it took me insisting that she call the woman from the night before to confirm to finally let us in, but it meant we stood there looking like jerks for half an hour wasting time. She clearly cared more about the process than common sense and customer service. Also, the cabs FROM this hotel cost more than if you book them separately. I recommend getting your taxi driver's card from your trip from the airport and arranging transport with him. There is a lovely roofdeck with pool, but it was too cold to use it.","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great Clean Hotel,but service needs to move higher","The Hotel is nice placed.The rooms are clean and tidy. The doorman is friendly but the service levels are mixed. Waiters are too busy to give you full attention.Serving you as they walk...the receptionist are good though there is a breakdown in communication.booked bed and breakfast, then was told its bed only.after telling the receptionist it was changed.Well, customer friendliness and smiles is only missing spark to make it a great hotel","Date of stay: March 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Bad customer service at Plaza Casino","The staff at the Plaza Casino, namely the bar staff and waiters, are incompetent, lazy and inhospitable. Not only have I experienced, but I witnessed how they do not rotate much around the casino floor, they would get orders from the tables and slots customers and the latter would end up walking to the bar counters themselves just to find their meals placed there unattended after what seems to be more than an hour of waiting. One rarely sees them cleaning up the empty glasses and used plates from the floor. They have attitude towards the customers and do not know how to address them properly. This kind of service is harming the reputation of Hilton Hotel and Plaza Casino, I suggest they start hiring more experienced and competent bar staff.","Date of stay: March 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"THIEVES at large .. Poorest service considering the brand","I had a very bad experience during my stay at this property. I stayed in this hotel for almost 4 months.Some staffs are nice i must say. But max of them including the upper layer of staffs are just thieves.I never had such issue even in the tiniest hotels in dangerous most places around the world.During my stay there i gave some of my clothes for laundry one day, including a sweat shirt(My fav one) that was gifted by my late grandfather.  They lost it  and said i have never given them any. I was furious about it as that was the last piece of materialistic attachment i had with my Grand father. Upon showing the laundry slip finally they agreed that they have  lost it and they said they will look into the matter. after continuous follow up by me they finally reimbursed the amount 7or 800NAD.I thought ok .. done is done.. I have been reimbursed so no point shouting about it..But to my utter dissatisfaction just before my last day i found that 500USD has been stone from my room safe. Safe is not at all safe in this hotel. But i thank to who so ever stole that money , because they were just settling scores. Thank god they didn't stole my passport....","Date of stay: February 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great hotel, nice staff, very attentive","We have been guest to the Hilton Windhoek twice within three weeks. The reception of the staff was really nice and attentive. They made a special arrangement for us as a surprise as they knew it was our anniversary. We have just been astonished and overwhelmed when we entered our room and found the special surprise. The breakfast in the restaurant is good but it would be helpful for early departures if it would open at 6.00 instead of 6.30 am. The roof top bar with the swimming pool is a great place for a sundowner.","Date of stay: November 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"N√£o merece 5 estrelas","Fic√°mos no Hilton em Windhoek e n√£o gostei.O Hotel foi remodelado e tem bom aspecto, mas o servi√ßo √© muito fraco e pouco focado no cliente.Assim que cheg√°mos presenci√°mos uma ligeira discuss√£o entre dois clientes e a senhora do front desk que fazia o check out. Acho que nesta situa√ß√µes o melhor √© chamar logo o supervisor e levar o cliente para longe. Esta situa√ß√£o atrasou o nosso check in. O nosso quarto estava pronto, mas um casal que fazia o check in na mesma altura teve que aguardar pois o quarto n√£o estava pronto - aten√ß√£o que eram cerca de 15 horas!Tamb√©m n√£o consigo conceber um hotel de 5 estrelas que a esta altura n√£o tem wifi nos quartos gr√°tis!

"There is just a little too much that goes wrong here","The Hilton has pros and cons. Let's start with the pros. The pool on the roof is nice. Peaceful, heated, great views. Breakfast is another. Has everything you want.Then there are the cons, of which there are a few.1. We had a booking through hotels.com. 5 People, 2 rooms. A couple of days before arriving I sent an email asking if they had a pickup service from the airport. I recieved no answer and thus assumed we would not be picked up. We were picked up all the same, but they thought they were pickin up one person, not five. That's a little odd? It got a little crowded in the car.2. Check in is excruciatingly slow. It litterally took ages. We're travelling with three kidsand wanted rooms next to each other. Check in is at 1400 hrs. They gave us 1 room, assuring us that the other would be available very soon. That took about 3 hours, way beyond check in time. We got annoyed, asked several times, and in the end it turned out the room had been ready the whole time, but housekeeping and reception had been unable to communicate that to anyone, despite our constant asking.3. Laundry. We had a bit of laundry. It all came back very quickly, but 5 tees and a pair of socks were lost. We're from Norway, were such tees can easily be 800 rand a piece. We also had designer tees a lot more expensive than that, but they were not lost. We've had endless discussions with staff about this, still nothing has been reimbursed, this is about a month ago now. In all fairness a manager cut through and decided we did not have to pay the about 800 rand for the washing. 4. Hotel needs to work on some routines. Our room neighbour had ordered room service. He then placed leftovers outside his room, probably expecting them to be removed. From what I could oberve that took at least 6 hours. The only Hilton I've stayed at before was in Tokyo. They would have removed this within 6 seconds I would guess.5. Wifi is not free, but at check in we were told they'd enroll us in some sort of program that would give us free wifi. When checking out they still wanted us to pay. Same manager cut through again, that's nice.All in all we're not too happy. We've been to Southern Africa several times, to Namibia too, but this reminded me more of East Africa than Southern Africa. It's a comfortable hotel, rooms are ok, the one manager was helpfull (though our clothes are still lost), but I don't think we will be returning to the Hilton.","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Pleasant experience ","This was my 1st stay and my expectations were high. I battled to find the entrance to the parking garage when I arrived late at night. Checking in went smoothly except they couldn't find my Hilton Honours number on their system. Room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was large and had a bath and a shower. Breakfasts were excellent and I enjoyed the pizza that I ordered for dinner from room service. I was irritated by the fact that on two occasions my electronic access card would not work in the lift and I had to get it reset. Check out was very slow because they did not split my bill into accommodation and breakfast (paid by travel agent) and additional charges. An unplanned expense was 2 nights parking at 60 dollars per night. Overall a good experience but not better than the other BnBs and other hotels in Windhoek.","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Do not use the spa","Hotel is nice, great location, but make sure you have your booking confirmation with you. I had to resend mine to the reception twice before the issues I had was fixed. Hotel is very clean and rooms are comfortable. I can't argue with that. DO NOT USE THE SPA. Go somewhere else.  The breakfast is amazing. High five to all the chefs and the staff who work hard to prepare it. There is a lot of construction around the hotel so expect to have some level of noise. The fitness  center is ok. if you have a good fitness imagination you can get a good workout in. Sky bar is cool - definitely worth going.","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"THIS HOTEL NEEDS LOVE IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE!!","Although this hotel is beautiful hotel in terms of its design, it needs great improvement in the following ways:  (1) the Internet needs major improvements. (2) the carpets in the rooms need to be replaced as they appear dirty and not properly cared for; (3) the curtains in the Executive Lounge need replacing, as they are dry rot and falling apart; and (4) the staff needs to be properly trained.I have been at the hotel on a business trip and have been working on my laptop from the hotel.  The Internet has only been working 60% of the time, as it keeps dropping.  Additional, there are pockets of time where it just does not work.  It is completely frustrating, and has lead to my decision not to stay here for my next trip to  Namibia.  I am here once a month for Board meetings.  The room design is one of the best I have experienced amongst the many hotels I have stayed in.  However, the rooms need a bit of love, and particularly, the carpets look very dirty, and I highly recommend replacement!!The disposition of the staff is always friendly and accommodating in typical Namibian style.  However, they clearly need additional training.  I was given a face cloth that was new, and it still had the tag on the face cloth when I picked it up to wash my face.  When we arrived there was a power outage and the front desk team couldn't check us in the room because the system was down.  The staff said that they couldn't find the Master Key, and thus couldn't allow us into the rooms which they had assigned for us.  So, they took us up to the Executive Lounge and asked us to wait until they could check us in.  No problem!!  However, after waiting 2 hours in the Lounge, I overheard the Lounge attendant tell a guest that had just arrived that the hotel was having power issues, however, he could use the Master Key to open his room for him.   At that moment, I was very confused, as it was obvious that someone had a Master Key which could be used to open the rooms.  Yet, we sat and waited for 2 hours before we were given access into our room.  Please send my compliments to ""Gabriel"" in the Executive Lounge, as he goes out the way to make the guest feel comfortable and satisfied!!","Date of stay: April 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Central location, motivated staff and excellent food","Centrally located in ""downtown"" Windhoek, it is an ideal location for any reason being in the city. Windhoek for those who are visiting for the first time, is a small city of approximately 400,000 inhabitants. It has influences of Africa combined with the country's german roots with an additional mix of Afrikaans influence (South African ""Dutch"") and a small white English language representation.The Hilton is not on a large plot of land but rather a 10-storey building overlooking the ""skyline"". The bar next to the small roof-top pool is great for chilling out. Rooms are excellent, modern with a touch of Africa....  The bar is also great on the 1st. floor and the restaurant is truly a hidden gem with a  wide range of quality to wet any appetite....Check out the way the head chef keeps the staff on the move... very impressive! If you don't see your favourite, ask... they will bend over backwards to help.Parking is a real driving challenge with lots of twists and turns downstairs.... there is also apparently a casino... sorry, don't gamble! The downside was the speed at which the lifts operated... You really need all three lifts to be operating and apparently one has not been working for over one month.... The icing on the cake is the excellent frequent guest facilities located on the top floor offering between 6 and 8pm (including alcoholic) drinks and finger food of excellent quality. All in all, a hotel that can proudly put the name Hilton on its facade!","Date of stay: February 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not reaching the Hilton standard as many problems in the hotels","The Hilton Windhoek was perfectly located, it was easily found. Hotel staff were polite, hotel room was tidy, breakfast was nice. We stayed there at the first night and the last night of my Christmas trip. Everything seemed to be fine at the first night, however after we checked out we found out that the hotel deducted more money from my credit card, after several rounds of checking and email communication, the hotel returned the money to me.At the last night of my trip, we stayed in Hilton again, that night was terrible! The pillow sheet was missing, the bath gel was missing, the hotline could not be reached by using the phone in room, there were lots of buzz noise during night, making me keep awake and awake during MIDNIGHT and finally I went to the reception in person to complain! It was a nightmare because it should not be the standard of the Hilton Hotel! Finally the hotel reduced the accomodation fee as compensation.","Date of stay: December 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Does not live up to Hilton standards","We booked this hotel for our last night in Namibia, as we were unable to stay at the lovely Airbnb we had had on  arrival. What a disappointment! The room was what we had expected, a good level of comfort, modern bathroom with good shower and a comfortable bed. However the pool which had appeared so inviting in the promotional pictures was small, and for a hotel of this size only eight loungers seems a little mean. Consequently on this Sunday afternoon there was not even anywhere to sit let alone lay. This situation was further compounded by a large number of people who were obviously not guests of the hotel. In general the atmosphere was not pleasant and the level of service was very poor with plates of congealed food lying around as well as dirty glasses. At the sky bar later in the evening the poor level of service was again evident when we had difficulty getting served and also paying our bill. They seemed to work on the principle of he who shouts loudest,Service in the restaurant was better, but the buffet meal was not impressive particularly in comparison to others we had in much cheaper hotels. The following morning the breakfast packs we were supposed to have were not forthcoming and we were informed that we should be paying for the parking although they did agree to waive this charge as we had not been informed of it on arrival. Altogether not a good experience and we would not recommend this Hilton. There are better places to stay in Windhoek.","Date of stay: November 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Hervorzuhebend ist auch das tolle Fr√ºhstp√ºcksbuffett mit einer sehr gro√üen Auswahl an lokalen und internationalen Speisen und Getr√§nken. Wir haben insbesondere die Smoothie-Bar genutzt.","Date of stay: August 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very nice, great service","I stayed here for two nights on my own before joining a safari. Very good service, the staff couldn't do enough for me.  The room was lovely, and even though next to the lifts I couldn't hear them at all.  The rooftop is fabulous, a nice way to spend a lazy afternoon and have sundowners. The restaurant is nice, food good, though not an extensive menu, but absolutely fine for a couple of nights.","Date of stay: September 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Average","I stayed at the hotel for business purposes. Now the city in general is very laid back. However they seemed to not attend to requests quickly at all at this hotel. The food was great here and the bar area was fantastic to catch a sun downer. The room was clean and pleasant to stay in.","Date of stay: May 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Bell'hotel, ottimo punto di partenza per un viaggio","hotel centrale, moderno, elegante, buon servizio, bella terrazza panoramica dove si pu√≤ prendere un aperitivo. Lo consiglio come punto di partenza e di arrivo per il vostro viaggio in Namibia. Wi-Fi solo nelle zone comune e non nelle camere. Unica nota spiacevole: avevamo dimenticato li l'adattatore per la presa elettrica, speravamo di ritrovarla quando abbiamo dormito di nuovo alla fine del viaggio, ma non l'avevano.","Date of stay: August 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Just the Front Desk","Everything as usual excellent. Room was as ever well furnished and kept in great order by the housekeeping staff. Food was well above average and service was to a high standard. Only two points keep me awarding 5*. The first is the excessive cost for the provision of internet in the room. As I was there on business I needed 7 day/week coverage which was $100 - This is by far te most I have been charged, in fact most hotels provide the service free. The other, less important one was the failure of staff at the front desk to deal with my early check in and then, having booked an extra night, phoned at 11pm on the night prior to my departure to ask why I hadn't checked out. Pity, otherwise a great hotel","Date of stay: June 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

From hotel, its 2 blocks to downtown shopping - just beware that the city shuts down at 5 pm, except for a few restuarants.

"Very good business hotel","The Hilton Windhoek has very comfortable and large rooms with good bedding which is important for me, but I was a little surprised by the open toilet and shower area which would be good for couples. The hotel has good facilities - swimming pool and a roof-top bar offering good views over the city. The spread at breakfast was good and I had the chance to visit the Executive Lounge which was stocked with food and drinks depending on the time of the day. The staff were prompt to handle requests and tried to engage in conversations with guests and I always felt welcomed during my stay. I thought a few areas that the hotel can improve on would be having more gym equipment - though I acknowledge that this might be difficult due to the small space. Wifi access should also be made available free of charge in the rooms rather an within the public area. This is already a luxury/business hotel so guests shouldn't be penalised if they need to get online to do work.","Date of stay: March 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great, Modern Hilton","Real good experience at this hotel.  Common space is nice, including restaurants, bars, and the pool.  Rooms are modern and clean.  Lounge was also particularly nice and the food spread in there was definitely above average.  Hotel is also quite central.  For comparison purposes, I found this Hilton to be very much like the Hilton in Auckland.Some staff appeared a bit unknowledgeable at times - about the town and the hotel - but overall service levels were pretty good.","Date of stay: February 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Mopane worms","Free Wifi is available outside your room and in common areas so if you stand real close to your door, you can connect.Pool area was very crowded; not many people in the water; the pool is just a small strip of a pool. No pool attendant so I had to ask several people to find out where to get a pool towel; they are in the exercise room.Room was very nice; great beds; nice and quiet.  Great aircon. Great bathroom and shower.Nice breakfast buffet.  They even have Nutella.Parking is in the basement and it is a little tricky to find the entrance.Dinner buffet on Friday night was local cusine so I had my fill of Mopane worms.  The rest of my family ordered off the ala carte menu and they were happy.Service and staff was excellent!","Date of stay: January 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good place to stay in Windhoek","OK, one thing every visitor should know is that Windhoek isn't the place to spend your Namibian vacation.  Oh, it's perfectly fine, and more than safe enough, but you should ""get in and get out"" ASAP.  We had a later afternoon arrival at the airport and an early morning flight out, so we spent two nights.  That was plenty.  Also, if you're in town on a Sunday, it's a complete ghost town (the nearby NICE restaurant, not really within walking distance, is one of the few places to eat on Sundays and I would recommend it).As a HHonors gold member, we got room upgrades (one better than the other), and free access to the executive lounge and breakfast.  Both the lounge and breakfast are above-average; honestly, the breakfast buffet is truly 5-stars, and probably the best feature of the hotel.  The executive lounge had free alcohol in the evening and put out enough dishes that you could make a meal out of it if you wanted to.The lounge is located on the pool level, where there is also an attractive Sky Bar.  The problem is that in boring Windhoek, the Sky Bar seems to be the place to go.  So it's popular with the locals.  This is bad for guests because there's too much ""scene"" there, and it makes the pool area and bar crowded and less desirable.Bottomline, as an HHonors Gold member, I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else in Windhoek.   That said, I wouldn't plan on staying any longer than I need to, either!","Date of stay: December 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"nice hotel, poor staff attitude","We stayed at the hotel the night of October 30, 2014, arriving in the evening with a group of travelers. In spite of the long advance notice of arrival, few of the registrations and keys had been done, resulting in a significant wait for a tired group. My wife and I went up to the lovely rooftop patio bar and I ordered a glass of brandy. This took nearly 30 minutes to be served, during which time the waitresses and bartenders were generally standing around doing nothing. The elevators in this hotel are not obvious to use, requiring some fancy button pushing. No signs, no advance warning from the front desk. Nearby staff were not interested in helping when asked. So physically this is a beautiful hotel and could be a nice spot to stay but for the poor staff attitude. If it were only one or two staff members we could shrug it off, but they were all that way - just disinterested and bored. This in turn suggests some sort of ongoing management problem. The one bright spot was the greeter at the morning breakfast buffet - he was wonderful and the food was excellent. However, next time in Windhoek we will stay elsewhere.","Date of stay: October 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great hotel but the customer service is lacking","I was initially allocated a smoking room on arrival and when I asked for a non-smoking room, I was told that there is nothing they can do for me. The manager has the same unhelpful manner. No offer to check if there are any cancellations were made. One of my colleagues offered to swap his non-smoking room with me as I had a cold. The experience was a big disappointment for me. The room was very spacious and beautiful. Negatives : no bottled water except in the bar fridge (charged) and R185 for 24h wifi. I will stay there again for the location but this time I will take my own bottled water and double check before I depart that I have been allocated a non-smoking room.","Date of stay: February 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The staff are super friendly, the rooms were gorgeous though during the day you can here loud music from some store blasting all day long and unfortunately it's the same darn song...We have executive rooms with lounge access.  Lounge was standard, it did the trick.  Concierge was great with arranging taxis to restaurants.  The rooftop pool is absolutely gorgeous!  But... it's leaking thru the roof of the hotel... you can see it dripping.... which is a big shame cause I believe the building is not very old.    That's going to be some major renovation in the upcoming months cause it's only going to get worse.

The shower door and shaving mirror were broken on our arrival but both were quickly repaired, or we were given the option of moving rooms (but were too tired!) Breakfast was a comprehensive buffet, from 0700 hrs weekends and 0630 hrs Mon-Fri- probably should be from 0600 hrs every day for those with early flights/activities to catch . Room service was variable and at times slow. The only draw back was having to pay for internet access, during our 17 days in Namibia this was the only place we were asked to pay to use the internet. We had 1 meal at the restaurant buffet, food was nice but nothing exceptional. Happy hour Mon-Fri in the bar on level 1 was good value, and you must enjoy drinks by the pool in the Skybar at sunset, lovely views over the city.","Date of stay: September 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lovely rooms & rooftop bar but Wifi crazy expensive","This is my second trip to Windhoek and we choose this hotel after a great experience last time. The rooms are spacious and lovely (great deep bath and double headed shower). The rooftop bar  and pool is perfect for watching the sun set over the city but it was not quite as nice as remembered. We stayed a week and housekeeping was a little inconsistent. This time there were no robes or slippers but the big problem was getting out of the shower after the room had been made up only to find that although the wet towels had been removed no new towels were provided!  A hand towel doesn't cut it! Turn down service was there for some nights but not others and on one occasion a staff member just let themselves into the room without even knocking. Wifi is ridiculously expensive and the lack of free wifi even in the lobby is disappointing. Particularly frustrating is that you have to pay for each device separately. To get a weekly access for my mac and my iPhone  (not even counting the iPad) would be more than $200 USD. Even for the business market this is pretty galling and it might contribute to me choosing to try the castle next time instead. All the same a very nice reliable hotel with great bar and lovely breakfast buffet.","Date of stay: May 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Beautiful Property in great location","We stayed here several days on three different occasions as we traveled around Namibia in January.  The rooms are great, the food is exceptional, the service was excellent and they have a lovely rooftop pool and bar with wonderful views of the city.  The beds are wonderful too!  Although there is a definite German influence in Windhoek (actually the entire country), we liked the Hilton as there was a very culturally diverse clientele staying in the hotel.It is in the heart of the city, close to shopping and a weekend open-air craft market.  I wouldn't say that Windhoek is a hopping city, but it is the capitol and largest city in Namibia and it is centrally located in the country. We heard there were some interesting evening shows, but we pretty much stayed close to the hotel.  We felt very safe around the hotel.","Date of stay: January 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lovely hotel, great views from the rooftop bar!","The executive room I had was magnificent in all respects.  Took a while to find the switch for the funny blue light near the loo, but after that, peace and sleep were mine!  The rooftop swimming pool was lovely, especially when the thunderstorms started all around, what a view!The only drawback of the hotel is the high cost of the WiFi, bu that is a general complaint I have about many good hotels all over the world.  I really feel we need free WiFi on all devices!","Date of stay: February 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good hotel in a good location.","The Hilton Hotel in Windhoek is probably the best in the area and is conveniently located in the city centre close to shopping malls and restaurants. The location is also very good if driving for the first time in Namibia as you will drive past it once coming into town.  The staff is very attentive and polite. The rooms are very clean (it is still fairly new, so lets hope this standard is upheld) and not too bad space wise. I never ate dinner in the restaurant on my previous visit, but walked down the road to a franchise steakhouse instead so cannot comment on the restaurant, although I have had meals here in the past on business meetings and the food was of a good to high standard if somewhat pricey (standard prices for hotel restaurants). While the TV option provided a good selection there were not too many sports channels, this may not be an issue for most travellers, but as I am on business a lot of the time I try to keep up with the Champions League, cricket other live sporting events etc. so a good selection of channels is always appreciated by myself. The only two issue‚Äôs I would have with the Hilton is, firstly, the charging of WiFi, the other ‚Äúluxury‚Äù hotel in the area (of a decent standard) the Country Club, does not charge for this at all, this is quite important when travelling on business. The rooms are also not as spacious as the Country Club, but are of a higher standard. Again, as I am on business most of the time the larger space and free WiFi makes the world of difference. I do understand that most hotels charge for WiFi these days, but, most of the other hotels in Windhoek don‚Äôt. All in all a very good hotel and I would definitely recommend it, but would take into account the very minor issues noted above. Finally, the major disappointment with this hotel is the charging of parking! I was actually shocked to be presented with a bill for overnight parking even though I was a guest at the hotel. I can understand this practice in major, congested cities, but this is not the case in Windhoek. This must be rectified by management of the Hilton as it does make you feel like they are trying to squeeze more money out of you!","Date of stay: March 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Speed of Service could be greatly improved","Great modern hotel and facilities but the service is way to slow. It needs immediate attention and takes away from a great looking place with good facilities. More memorable than the looks are the slowness of service, food takes an hour to be delivered regardless if you are ordering one plate or food six.","Date of stay: February 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Beautiful Hotel, bad bad service!","You cannot complain about the facilities at this hotel.  Everything is still new and looks good.  What absolutely brings this hotel down is the service standards.  The rooftop pool bar, again beautiful with an amazing view of the city, was a complete disappointment when it came to try to get a drink or something to eat.  After 20 minutes of looking for staff, we went down to the restaurants on the mezzanine level.  While there was 1 waiter, the service was super slow.  What we ordered was substituted with different ingredients without consulting us, wraps not toasted, burgers completely overdone and when we pointed this out there was complete indifference from the waiter.  We made a point of seeking out the chef and manager to complain about not only the service but the quality of the food.  The manager ended up giving us our full lunch and drinks on the house because of the unacceptable experience.  I will stay here again but make sure I have my meals elsewhere!","Date of stay: September 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good but let themselves down","A good hotel but let themselves down with silly mistakes! On first stay we enjoyed a nice meal in the main restaurant (buffet but had a la carte) Overall first stay was 4.5/5*However, the second time let yourselves down as we purchase some internet and on one took the code given to transfer to a different device but ended being charged for 4 internets, when was only 3 used! IT chap was extremely rude and ignorant, when talking to us it was like he was saying 'what do you lot know about IT' Eventually had to pay for it as rude front desk girl wouldn't budge! eventually just before we left 1 hour later she refunded 1 internet charge! On the positives, the indian buffet is sublime and the chocolate cake they served (not sure how indian that is) was outstanding!","Date of stay: July 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Date evening","My husband and I went on a date night and overnite at Hilton Hotel in Windhoek.Not sure about the date. think it was August last year.He planned something nice which he mentioned to me. Our agreement was that I will book in first and he will join me later. Upon arrival the room was not as he asked and I had to arrange with front desk and housekeeping to get the room as he wanted it. Romantic....Needless to say I had to book a massage to get me to relax. The rest of the date was great. I would recommend their spa and wellness facility anytime.

"Lovely hotel, great facilities, service could be better but by no means bad!","Very swish hotel in a great location.  I only stayed in a standard room but it had excellent facilities, very spacious, modern, clean and the bed was super comfortable.  Another bonus in the room was the good lighting - when travelling for work and working in your room it is so noticable how badly lit most hotel rooms are but this was excellent and very comfortable to work in.  Only downside was no wireless internet access from your room (although there is cabled access).  The food, bar and restaurant facilities were excellent and the view from the roof top bar across Windhoek at night is lovely.  The service from the reception desk is a little hit and miss, there are some excellent staff members who are very attentive and quick to help but there are also some not quite up to scratch (or perhaps just inexperienced given it is a new hotel).  Overall though a great place to stay, and should defintely be a hotel of choice for both business travellers and holiday makers spending time in windhoek.","Date of stay: July 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not that impressive","On holiday with my family and stayed overnight in the Hilton Windhoek. I do travel a lot and is used to the best hotels in the world, this one was pretty disappointing.The Hilton is luxurious (as you would expect) with a friendly staff and good clean accommodation. This is were is ends. The heated pool was was cold (heat pump broke). We were allocated a room with an inter-leading door for the children. The children's room was not ready at the time of check-in so we initially unpacked our luggage in the 1 room. After numerous phone calls to reception (without response), eventually we were told we had to move to a different room all together. This is after we unpacked! I was not happy. We ordered Mojitos but they did not have mint leaves!We had dinner in the hotel restaurant and waited for our food for more than an hour and they got the whole order wrong!! The next morning we had breakfast in the same restaurant. On arrival the buffet area was empty with no sausages, eggs, bacon etc etc etc. I made a fuss and after 15 min this was stocked up again. I ordered a omelet, this never arrived. The whole experience was pretty disappointing and not what you expect from a Hilton hotel. I'm not convinced I will go there again.","Date of stay: June 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Best Modern Hotel in Windhoek","This is the best hotel in Windhoek! We came in from Botswana via truck and called beforehand because we knew we would arrive past the COVID imposed curfew. The hotel explained they would be ready to receive us at anytime. After two roadblocks, one telling us we would have to sleep overnight on the road until 4am, we arrived at the Hilton around 1130 pm. We stayed in the executive king  room with lounge access. Although the lounge was not open at the top floor, there was a  lounge area in the restaurant. The room was very nice with a modern feel. Great water pressure from the shower and the large bath was great for my 2 young girls. The hotel is 10 years old, so relatively new. The foot at the restaurant was great. The pool at the top of the hotel is very nice and has a great view over looking the city and mountains. We brought lunch up to the top and had a great time. The staff were great here and the hotel is really a five star hotel for this region. Location is great too for shopping and food, and close to museums. When we come back to Namibia, we will be sure to stay here before or after the flights!","Date of stay: July 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The best Hilton in all Namibia","Friendly, hard working, lovable staff.  The infrastructure isn't bad at all but it feels like from the 1960's presumably because the planners or architects used cheap materials. Shame on them. The hotel already feels rund down. It doesn't feel like a Hilton level but all OK if you only stay a couple of nights.","Date of stay: May 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Unfortunately, nothing has changed.Reception staff are simply not focused at all, they lack professionalism and friendliness.I had to double check my transfer arrangements again to avoid not getting to the airport on time (again).Every single ‚Äúfacility‚Äù is chargeable.

"A Welcome Addition to the Windhoek Hotel Scene","This was my fifth time in Windhoek and my first stay at the Hilton. It is nice hotel, with a beautiful architecture, open feel, and very sleek decor. The room was large and tastefully furnished, and the bathroom was one of the nicest I have enjoyed on my recent travels. After a long transaltlantic travel, I slept really well in the comfortable king-size bed. The rooftop pool area was very relaxing, although a bit crowded, with some loud patrons that nobody seemed willing to control somehow. But a good book and the stunning view of Windhoek let me forget the distraction.So all was well during my stay? Well, there is room for improvement. For one, I got exactly the opposite of what my Hilton Honors profile indicated as my room preferences (I usually ask for a high floor, non-smoking room, away from the elevator--and I got a lower floor smokers' room right near the elevator). The worst part was the smokers' smell in the room, which was made worse by the fact that windows could not be opened and the AC temperature could not be adjusted (the temperature setting buttons did not react). I could have probably asked for a change of rooms, but did not want to go through the hassle. I also noticed some other minor maintenance issues, including scratched walls and furniture. And I heard from other guests that the breakfast was not worth the charge; I opted to have breakfast at a small cafe in the Voigt shopping center five minutes away. But in sum, I am glad that the Kalahari Sands Hotel--the other main business hotel in town--got competition from the Hilton, and I would consider the Hilton several notches better. And based on the manager's response to other reviews, I trust that the Hilton will further improve its service delivery and ensure proper upkeep of the facility.","Date of stay: November 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The hotel is centrally located and it is a very short walk to a good selection of tourist shops and cafes and also the local craft market is close by.  The hotel has a great roof top pool and bar overlooking the city.  Our room was large and comfortable, as was the bed.  Breakfast served at the hotel is excellent and extensive, the pastries were to die for.  We dined in the main dining room two evenings and our meals were fantastic, it had a very good menu, which included game. Full credit to the kitchen staff here. Our wonderful waitress Anna ensured we had the best of service - what an asset she is to the hotel.  We really enjoyed chatting with her.

"One night only - honeymoon luxury","Had a great stay at the Hilton Windhoek. I happened to mention it was my honeymoon when booking and Brandon in Customer Relations upgraded us to an executive suite with lounge access. As if this wasn't enough, we arrived back after a stroll around the city to bubbles, nibbles and a massive bouquet of flowers to congratulate us. Beyond impressed. Bed massive and comfortable, breakfast superb, skybar/pool very inviting (although it was Winter so we did not use them) and location great. Would not hesitate to stay again. Only gripe - shower despite being on 'full hot' was pretty lukewarm. I could have called reception, but for just an overnight stay, I was happy to let it go.

When we were getting ready to pack to leave, I noticed that an ATH-ANC7b notice cancelling headphones(audio-technica) were missing. I told the front desk and they would contact security. I never heard from security. Later I found that I was missing $250.00 from my backpack. I never contacted the front desk because I never heard back about my missing  headphones.

"Second time was not the charm","Once arriving at the hotel, we were given our key and went up to the room. The porter opened the closet and there was someone else's luggage in it along with hangers that were empty.  The hotel room did not look as if anyone had been in, other than the luggage. So, we called the desk and they told us to bring all of our belongs down and they would move us. We haul all of it down and they said they were leaving us in that room and that the porter had left luggage there accidentally.  Keep in mind, there were empty hangers from someone's dry cleaning.  On the same day, our friends were with us also and we were checking in at 8pm at night and they were told their room was not ready.  So, we were not happy, after having made the arrangements months prior.  They apologized and my friends did get upgraded and settled.We had other issues with keys and didn't like the fact that we could not visit other friends on two other floors without the major annoyance of having extra keys to those floors.  Also, the hotel has a bad leak from the pool and drips and is causing floor problems on level 5 and issues with the carpeting that was not very pleasing.  It seems to need some upgrading.","Date of stay: September 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Well... Not really WOW!","Spend 3 nights at Hilton Windhoek in September 2014 with a friend. We booked a room with separate beds. Upon early arrival we were told that rooms are not available yet, since the check-in policy is 2pm, but we were promised to have a room ready within 1 hour. Ok - we waited. 1 hour later we checked back with the reception, where we have been told that they are waiting for bed sheets. Another 1 hour later the bed sheets were there - but it was a double-bedded room. Not with twin beds. The procedure startet all over again. and again - they waited for bed sheets. I started seriously questioning from where those sheets are delivered... From mars? Venus? Saturn? Another 2 hours later - no bed sheets yet. But they could offer us a room which is ready - with a double bed. Why would I repeat a 3rd time that we have asked for twin-beds???? Finally - at 12 noon we got a room. Which was the biggest disappointment EVER! Open bathroom culture. I fully understand that this might be up to african standards, but sure not to european or cosmopolitan standards. If you don¬¥t travel with your husband, wife, family or so - who would like to do a peep-show and undress naked before every shower in front of others? Who would like to do his/her ""big business"" (you know what I mean) and let this favorite personal smell move out to share? Oh, what disgusting... If you travel alone, this might somewhat be acceptable. With fellows - NO WAY! In some situations I love my privacy!Positive aspects: breakfast - all someone¬¥s heart desires. Wonderful rooftop-bar with a view over Windhoek.All in all: don¬¥t do promises which you can¬¥t keep. If your check-in policy is 2pm - accepted. But don¬¥t pull someones leg by keeping them on hold. And - put walls between your bathroom and room. This is a NO GO!!!! Would I visit Hilton Windhoek again? Alone: maybe, with fellows in same room: no way.","Date of stay: September 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Terrible service from staff.","We stayed for 2 nights at this hotel, although the room was of a very high standard everything else was awful. -Check In- Very slow, staff did not come across as friendly, no eye contact.-Bar service - The worst ever, we stood for 15 mins at the bar waiting to be served. Finally we had our order taken but it took another 10 mins to poor a glass of wine (only 1 to choose from as they'd run out of stock) !!-Breakfast- Arrived in dinning room, was not shown to a table despite a member of staff  asking for our room number, they seemed completely distracted by other staff/friends. Was not offered any tea or coffee had to ask a member of staff who's job it would appear to be to serve tea and coffee but was more interested in their mobile phone. . Terrible!-Although I can not prove this there would appear to be some obvious prostitution going on the bar  in the evenings, perhaps this is the norm but I've certainly never been exposed to it quite so obviously  as it was there.Such a shame as the hotel is lovely and could do so much better.","Date of stay: January 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappearing glasses and other housekeeping woes","This was my 2nd stay at the Windhoek Hilton and, like other travelers, I continued to be charmed by the rooftop SkyBar views and general centralized location. However, the housekeeping left much to be desired - after 3 days of asking to have my bed linens changed, I finally had to take the linens off the bed and pillows and place them in a pile on the floor to have fresh ones put on the bed. Also due to the fairly costly glasses of wine at the bar, my colleagues and I nipped across the street to purchase wine at the local Checkers. Using the collective glasses from our rooms to drink our tasty Pinotage, we found ourselves without replacement water glasses (even though we brought the dirty glasses back to the room) for the remainder of the stay...punishment for undermining corporate profits, perhaps? Will I stay there again? - most likely, yes. Would I recommend to you? Yes, but with caution - expensive Internet, food and drink on site. Cheap food and drink nearby to overcome part of the problem; with the additional suggestion that you purchase a wireless network card with minutes from outside provider. The sunsets are spectacular.","Date of stay: May 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Five Star Hilton? I don't think so.....","I stayed at your hotel on a business trip. I met with my clients in the executive bar on the 9th floor. Friendly staff memebers. 1) My clients orded Windhoel beer, just to be informed that they had none. 2) I wanted a Bells whiskey, just to be infirmed that they had no Bells, but they have Jameson. 3) I order a Jameson just to be informed that they had no whiskey! 4)I also order a pizza, chicken and mushroom in my room. Just to be informed that there were no mushrooms for my pizza. 5) By the way,there was no menu in the room. I had to request one from room service. 6) The water pressure is very poor for a shower.I have stayed at various Hilton hotels all over the world,but I have never had such a bad experiance.","Date of stay: November 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Perfect location","We stayed at the Hilton Windhoek for 3 nights in mid-April.  We used HH points for an Executive room with Executive Lounge access.  The room was clean and quiet and nicely laid out.  The bed was comfortable and we had no issues with the WiFi.  Staff were pleasant and friendly.  The food in the Executive Lounge was outstanding, both in the morning and the evening.  We had lunch one day in the restaurant and it was very good.  The location is great for getting everywhere in the City Center.  We walked 9 miles on the first full day we were there, which being a Sunday meant very little was open!","Date of stay: April 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Bitte etwas mehr Sauberkeit.","Nach ca. einer halben Stunde Fahrt vom Flughafen erreicht man das Hilton. Der Check-in lief z√ºgig und wir konnten in unser Zimmer. Dies hat mir nicht besonders gefallen. Wenn man hineinkommt, sieht man direkt ins Bad, alles ist offen. Einfach nicht mein Ding diese offenen B√§der. Ansonsten ist das Zimmer renovierungsbed√ºrftig. Es wirkt nur alt. Besonders gest√∂rt haben mich jedoch die vielen Haare des Reinigungspersonals. Minibar ist leer, Getr√§nke k√∂nnen bestellt werden. Highlight des Hotels ist auf jeden Fall die Dachterrasse. Es gibt eine nette Bar, einen Pool und alles ist neu. Es war ein sehr angenehmer Nachmittag hier.Das Fr√ºhst√ºck hatte alles was das Herz begehrt und auch abends im Restaurant hat das Hilton eine sehr gute Karte.","Date of stay: November 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Room was Dirty","I checked into this hotel after a couple days of camping in the Namibian desert.  I was really looking forward to checking in, and getting cleaned up from the grime of camping.  The check-in process was inordinately slow, not because there was a line, but because the front desk was very slow and seemed to have a great deal of difficult in finding my reservation,  Although, I had been in the same hotel just 6 nights previously, they were also unable to find my Hilton Honors number.  When I finally got to the room it was dirty - not blatantly so, but there were food stains on the night stands, and other general lack of cleanliness that made me wonder what other dirt there was that wasn't quite as visible.  I did use one of the very few towels provided to wipe food stains off furniture.  Note that the first night I stayed at this hotel it had a hot water malfunction, and when I arrived in the evening apparently the water had not yet heated, so I had to take a cold shower - an unpleasant experience in the middle of Africa's winter.  The breakfast at the hotel was quite good.","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Toller Ausgangspunkt f√ºr eine Namibia Reise","Das Hilton in Windhoek k√∂nnen wir nur empfehlen.

Das Essen im Restaurant ist gut und das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet √§usserst reichhaltig. Einziger Sch√∂nheitsfehler ist das eher unpraktische Mobiliar im Zimmer.

"Rather dull experience in a rather dull city","I must admit upfront that we stayed here for 2 nights over the Easter Weekend in April 2017, which may account for a part of the crushingly mediocre flavour both of Windhoek and the Hilton on the whole.The total cost was around R5000 all in for B&B.I found this to be is a reasonably good, average, luxury hotel.  The rooms are adequate and comfortable (2x 3/4 beds), although why it is necessary to endure the  ugly brown and green colours, and extremely complex but ineffective lighting designs in the rooms, is anyone's guess.  Our view from room 221 was of a building site and a huge stagnant body of water at its side.   No turn-down service.The bathroom is basically part of the room and is not sealed off in the old-fashioned way.  The shower was good but the tiled floor very slippery; good Hilton-brand cosmetics.Check in was a bit confused - we had booked through booking.com and the terms appeared to be unknown to the reception desk.What really stood out were the breakfasts - an excellent buffet of everything you could want, including freshly squeezed juices, diverse pastries and even smoked salmon.On the other extreme, the pool area and gym on the roof are much too small, hot and overcrowded.  The constant music was terrible (just like a European beach-party); cleaning/clear-away services poor; the general crush of humanity unpleasant.  We fled.Plentiful parking but lack of explanation as to how it works.No consistent Wi-Fi to speak of - it is supposed to be free in the lobby but charged for in the rooms.Windhoek generally a dull city and a waste of time for anything more than a stop-over.Would not rush to stay here again: perhaps try to find something more traditional or charming in another part of the city; charm generally in short supply, I suspect.","Date of stay: April 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Relaxed and comfortable stay after overland trip from Victoria Falls","I have stayed at Hilton hotels for business in Australia which have all been excellent.  The reviews on TripAdvisor for Hilton Windhoek have been a bit mixed but the two nights we stayed for leisure in September 20i6 were excellent. Reception and check-in were friendly and hassle-free, the room was quiet, clean, good size and the bed was very comfortable.  Staff helpful and frinedly.  Breakfast was fresh with excellent range of fruit and cooked items.  We ate at the Kalabar and food and drink was tasty and reasonably priced.

"Business trip to Windhoek, Namibia","I have not been to Namibia for about 2 years now and for this visit I stayed at the Hilton Windhoek.It is truly a lovely business hotel. Classy, comfortable, functional, and clean. The staff are very courteous and professional, the amenities are in excellent condition, the service is good, the food is good, and it is within walking distance of most government offices.The view of the city from the gym or swimming pool is enough to make you want to go to the gym.The only thing I was unhappy with was the wifi. It was slow and frustrating and I do not know if it is regular thing or just for this week. Even at that, I will still recommend the hotel to any business traveler.","Date of stay: June 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A little dissapointing","We have stayed here before, so we booked again for a return holiday to Namibia.  Staff are really friendly, but the hotel has deteriorated since we were there last.  We stayed on the second floor and were 12 people travelling together.  The hotel was not very full.  Our room had missing floor tiles and the glass 'wall' that separates the entrance from the bathroom is no longer there, so you can see the door from the shower and the bath.  All the rooms we were booked into were like that.  The glass panels were simply not replaced.  Massive construction is going to take place right next to the Hilton soon, just so you know if you're planning on staying there.  We could not eat A la Carte in the restaurant, because we were more than 12 people.  Yes, 'What!?"" Is exactly what we thought too.  We were told when we booked in that we don't need to make a reservation for the restaurant, because the hotel is not that full.  We arrived at dinner with an option of buffet or a la carte, but only if we're 5 people or less.  Huh? So I asked the manager on duty at the restaurant if we could eat a la carte if we left and came back in 5 at a time.  She said: ""That is a very good question"".  Needless to say, we left it at that.........On the plus side.  Great location!","Date of stay: December 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Classic Hilton Hotel","I stayed at this Hilton for a couple of weeks on business.  It is conveniently located downtown and has a good restaurant, two bars, exercise room, spa, and an odd rooftop, one lane lap pool.  The staff are attentive and friendly.  The internet is not fast, but that may be the same in all Namibian hotels.  I heard from friends that internet in most Windhoek hotels is not speedy.  I have a general complaint about the Hilton brand of hotels making internet access a separate profit center.  Just like water and electricity, no hotel should think of offering a room without internet already included!  The Housekeeping staff were good about providing an ironing board and iron, and kept my room clean.The restaurant staff were friendly quickly recognized long term guests.","Date of stay: June 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Noise from road is significant all night doors closing and people talking in the atrium can be heard clearly.

"A return visit, one year later, and still enjoying what I found","I stayed here on no fewer than 3 separate occasions during a near month-long odyssey around Namibia to visit a few conservation projects and catch up with old friends. I traveled in Dec. 2014, and stayed over on New Year's Eve.I stayed here once before, a year earlier, on my first visit, and was mightily impressed.One always has some trepidation and anxiety returning to a place where one had a good experience before, but I needn't have worried: The Hilton Windhoek was the same friendly place I remembered from Dec., 2013.Things I liked: Small, clean, comfortable, friendly & attentive staff, and some really clever use of glass, angles, architecture, etc. Electronic key cards that operate on a swipe & scan system, not the dated shove-it-in-shove-it-out-and-hope-that-it-works key cards that so many other hotels, including most Hiltons, use.I stayed in a basic economy room, and I love the fittings ‚Äî comfortable bed, the option of a bath or shower, comfortable work desk and plenty of plug-ins, including both European and the African plug-ins (the standard Africa-wide triple plug, not the neurotic, impossble-to-find 3-prong plug-in that, for whatever reason, Namibia seems to use).Reliable wifi ‚Äî though (a pet peeve of mine) it does come with a fee. That's not the hotel; that's Hilton policy.A plus: A good TV package that gives you ready access to English Premier League soccer, which for me was a real added bonus I hadn't quite expected. Hilton should really pay more attention to this property: I've stayed in (much) more expensive Hilton Airport properties in Amsterdam and Frankfurt, and the TV packages there are truly pathetic. Never mind trying to find a soccer game; it's as if soccer does;t exist. Because, as Hilton in Germany knows well, nobody in Germany cares about soccer, nobody there plays the game and nobody passing through Germany would want to watch a soccer game while staying a couple of nights between 11-hour flights.Namibia is a gorgeous country, with much to recommend it, despite the social problems inevitable to any country in sub-Saharan Africa, even relatively developed SA.Windhoek is a lovely little town, and the Hilton is right on top of the main shopping district. It may not be London or Paris but there are plenty of sidewalk cafes and decent places to eat.I'm sure a few travellers on this site have had founds things to complain about, but for my money this hotel is a little gem in the Hilton family. If you're travelling with kids, or on your own as I was, I can't think of any place that could be better. Namibia is known for its guest farms, and there are some truly courteous and comfortable places to stay throughout the country, but if you're looking for more of a business/corporate hotel with amenities, and you don't want to be gouged, I really don't think you can go wrong here. As I keep saying, I've stayed in a lot of Hiltons ‚Äî from the Beverly Hilton to the Universal Hilton, to Hiltons in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Nairobi, and this one is a real little jewel. The staff, the management, everyone associated with this hotel deserves to be commended.","Date of stay: December 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Very friendly service and the views from the roof top terrace are really spectacular.We stayed in an executive room and therefore had lounge access, where the staff had been very helpful to solve a problem and book us into a restaurant at the same night ( although it was a public holiday).

"First visit nice, second OK","Stayed here for one night upon arrival in Namibia.  After a self drive 12 day tour of beautiful Namibia, we checked back in for an 8 day stay.  We booked a deluxe room and did not receive an upgrade - that's OK as the deluxe room is very nice.  But as Diamond HH there was no welcome note nor any amenities that we usually receive (bottle of wine & fruit in Sandton).  I really would recommend a deluxe room because the standard king we had on our first stay does not have much privacy.  There are sliding glass panels that serve as bathroom walls and if they are not aligned up a certain way, anyone coming to your room door and see directly into the bathroom and/or see someone sitting up in bed.  There is no separation at all between the bathroom tub/sink area and the bedroom so you'd better be traveling with your ""significant other"".  The executive lounge is small but they have friendly folks working there and a nice breakfast and evening snacks and drinks.  Sadly you can not take even a small bottle of water out of the lounge.  There is free wifi if you are Diamond HH but there is a parking charge.  Location in the middle of downtown is great for business or tourism.","Date of stay: October 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The staff were friendly, check in was a little slow, the room is quite nice and spacious, one night we got a nice room with a great outdoor patio, the 2nd night we were given a room next to the elevator which was quite noisy, plus the bed was facing the bathroom which has a night light that couldn't figure out how to cut off and it affected my sleep. The buffet was nice, nothing extravagant but nice options of indian food at the night we stayed. The sky bar has a great set up, very relaxing to spend an afternoon there having a drink and ordering some bar food. Overall it's a nice hotel and we will stay there again if we ever return to Namibia.","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"‚ÄùExcelente localiza√ß√£o, servi√ßos de qualidade‚Äù","Hotel urbano de 5 estrelas com localiza√ß√£o privilegiada no cora√ß√£o de Windhoek. O conceito contempor√¢neo do hotel foca-se num estilo mais citadino, dado o seu contexto e localiza√ß√£o pr√≥ximo da cidade, mas n√£o menos elegante.Com um lobby amplo, a decora√ß√£o s√≥bria surge ponteada aqui e ali com motivos √©tnicos de muito bom gosto. No piso t√©rreo, uma pequena esplanada serve comidas ligeiras ideais para uma refei√ß√£o r√°pida.No √∫ltimo piso, com uma vista panor√¢mica da cidade, um terra√ßo com piscina e bar. N√£o sendo um espa√ßo muito grande, est√° bem estruturado e com mobili√°rio adequado, com sof√°s e espregui√ßadeiras que possibilitam relaxar com uma vista espl√™ndida da cidade. N√£o foi poss√≠vel a utiliza√ß√£o da piscina, porque  obras de repara√ß√£o estavam a decorrer.Quarto com razo√°vel dimens√£o, confort√°vel, arejado e sofisticado, com excelentes produtos de toilette, caracter√≠stico dos hot√©is da cadeia Hilton. A decora√ß√£o do quarto √© moderna com cores claras. A casa de bando e o quarto n√£o s√£o divis√µes estanques, apenas separadas por grandes pain√©is de vidro.No geral, foi uma boa estadia.

"Our first Windhoek visit.","This hotel is OUTSTANDING!  The management and staff have a remarkable synergy that provides a very hospitable, customer-first atmosphere.  We spent seven days there and could not have enjoyed ourselves more anywhere.  The breakfast buffet on the Mezzanine level is fabulous.  The Fitness Center on the top floor is well equipped with modern, clean, functional components.  I am currently using a physical therapy routine on my knees and hips prescribed by an orthopedic surgeon.  The Fitness Center allowed me to follow this routine precisely.  The view of Windhoek from the top floor facilities is hypnotic.  The location is within walking distance to great shopping and enjoyable historical and cultural museums.  You will enjoy your stay immensely.","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Airport to Hotel Transfer Scary","I have stayed here a couple of times on business and have always been met at the Airport by a member of the Hilton's staff, in uniform and with a nice vehicle. I arrived last Sunday, February 9th and had to ring the hotel as nobody was there upon my arrival. A young guy, casually dressed turns up with my name on a card. Outside it is clear that it is his private car that I am getting into. The seat belt didn't appear to work so I moved over into another seat. The driver started to text message on his phone......I mentioned that I thought it was illegal to use his phone, he then stopped!Throughout the journey he broke the speed limit and drove to close to vehicles in front. Despite my comments about his driving he continued. Upon arrival at the hotel I raised my concerns to the Duty Manager, Imogen.  Being met at the airport is the first experience of the Hilton Brand and if I hadn't stayed here before I wouldn't be impressed. I understood from my conversation with Imogen that I wouldn't be charged for the transfer but upon checkout found this not to be the case. Asked for the Manager but was advised that no one was on duty!Despite this I am pleased that the standard within the hotel is being maintained, as it has been open for a couple of years. The rooftop bar and pool is beautiful and the bar on the 1st floor has a lovely outside area. Service could sometimes be a little slow. Oysters are on the restaurant menu but was advised that they haven't been available for months.One thing to note is the cost of Wi-fi, surprising that it is not free to residents.","Date of stay: February 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very good hotel","We stayed here in business in October 2013.  The Hilton brand is always dependable and this one is no exception.  It is very centrally located, has wonderful clean rooms and a superb ""Sky Bar"" on the roof.  It is within easy walking distance to many shopping and dining options in downtown Windhoek.  It is definitely worth a repeat visit in future.","Date of stay: October 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice rooms and facilities, but average service","The rooms and restaurants/bars at this hotel are pleasant, clean and spacious. The food and cocktails were nice. However I found some of the services lacking e.g. No parking spaces available, no local currency available for change (even after being told to return on 5 occasions), and generally slow service. The price is quite high, and I would expect a higher level of service for that kind of money.","Date of stay: October 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Worst Hilton in the world","The premises itself is nice as it is still new. No doubt it is Hilton. However, the quality of the services provided by the staffs were VERY terrible. Services were a bit slow and sometimes rude. What is more, to my surprise, when I came into room, I found that the room has not been cleaned yet. Then, called the housekeeping. after minutes later, cleaning woman came and said ""where is dirty?"" with anger.I do not want to recommend this Hilton, but I think there is no choice but to stay here if you get convenient stay in windhoek. In Windhoek, Hilton would be the best choice though.. Others look much older and this Hilton is not so expensive in fact.","Date of stay: December 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Bedingt empfehlenswert","Wir, eine Gruppe von 5 Personen wohnten 2 Mal in diesem Hotel. Beim ersten Besuch war fast alles ok, wenn man davon absieht, dass wir, ein Ehepaar, ein Zimmer mit 2 Betten bestellt hatten und ein Zimmer mit einem King-size-Bett bekamen. Auch der Preis stimmte nicht, wurde aber berichtigt. Beim 2. Besuch landeten wir aus Maun/Botswana kommend in Windhoek. Meine Frau rief aus Maun das Hotel an und bestellte die Abholung. In Windhoek gelandet, war niemand da. Wir riefen wieder im Hotel an. Man sagte uns, dass das Auto unterwegs sei und in 15 Minuten eintreffen w√ºrde. Nach fast einer Stunde Warten riefen wir wieder an: Der Wagen werde jede Minute eintreffen. Nachweiteren 15 Minuten war er endlich da. Die Fahrt ins Hotel dauert genau 35 Minuten!!!!! Im Hotel angekommen, machten wir unserem √Ñrger Luft, wonach sich die Dame an der Rezeption entschuldigte und versprach, die Abholung nicht in Rechnung zu stellen. Wir bekamen wieder ein Zimmer mit nur 1 Bett obwohl mit 2 Betten bestellt. Nachdem dieser Fehler behoben war, wurde uns ein neues Zimmer zugewiesen. Mitten im Zimmer befand sich im Teppichboden ein 10cm grosser Fleck. Am n√§chsten Tag baten wir um Reservierng eines Tisches in einem bestimmten Restaurant f√ºr das Abendessen. Im Restaurant angelangt, wusste man nichts von der Reservierung. Auf unsere Frage nach der R√ºckkehr ins Hotel entschuldigte man sich f√ºr die Nichtreservierung. Schwierig wurde es dann wieder mit der Rechnung. Der Preis stimmte nicht und der Transport vom Flughafen ins Hotel stand auch auf der Rechnung. Das Hotel in erstklassiger Lage mitten in der Stadt macht sonst einen sehr guten Eindruck. Die Zimmer sind ger√§umig und modern ausgestattet. Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist auch ok. W-Lan muss man - wie in allen Hilton - bezahlen.","Date of stay: August 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"F√ºr Business- Reisende nur bedingt geeignet...","Das Hotel wurde erst vor ca 4 Monaten er√∂ffnet und befindet sich zentral im Stadtzentrum. Man merkt, dass das Team noch nicht eingespielt ist, besonders wenn es darum geht eine Bestellung aufzunehmen. Die Zimmer sind ok, allerdings unbedingt Zimmer (100, 101, 200, 201...) meiden, da sich diese direkt hinter den Aufz√ºgen befinden und man st√§ndig den Aufzug h√∂rt. Das Gym ist f√ºr Win neues Hotel ein Witz, kaum Ger√§te, mangelnde Sauberkeit. Top ist die Roof Top bar auf dem 9. Stock inclusive kleinem Pool. Ideal f√ºr 'nen Sun Downer!F√ºr Business- Reisende: Internet kostet extra, Uebertragungsrate sehr niedrig, d.h. das Versenden von Dokumenten, etc. unmoeglich!","Date of stay: July 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Standard's Slipping ","Hotel services were not up to standard this trip. Despite booking well in advance and being a corporate guest and Honors member room allocation was not ideal with low room with unsightly view. Had to return to reception on numerous occasions for door key not activating for either room or lift. Had cold water in the basin day 1 and luke warm shower. On Day 2 cold water for both. The coffee in the room was Decaff only. WIFI was constantly dropping and cannot be used seriously for business purposes. As a regular corporate traveller around Africa, the hotel is lacking a few basic amenities which competitor hotels stock e.g. Facecloth, Gown and slippers, Shaving kit, sewing kit, rusks etc.Hilton Windhoek seems to be down to the bare basics.On the positive side the restaurant and Spa were excellent and the view from the Skybar on the 9th floor is unsurpassed.","Date of stay: May 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Schlechtester Aufenthalt in einem Hilton Hotel","Schon beim Check In haben wir 1 Stunde auf unser Zimmer gewartet, angeblich, weil sie es - wie wir im Voraus gebucht haben - f√ºr 3 Personen fertig machen m√ºssen. Nachdem wir im Zimmer ankamen, war es nur f√ºr 2 gerichtet. Zur√ºck an der Rezeption hie√ü es erst, es w√ºrde nur ein Doppelbett m√∂glich sein. Nach Diskussionen kam dann das Zustellbett und Handt√ºcher. Im Bad und in der Dusche waren fremde Haare, und unter den Vorh√§ngen Dinge vom Vormieter. Das Dinner als Buffet war ok, das Fr√ºhst√ºck, welches wir mitgebucht hatten, war nur passabel. Einzig der Blick und das Personal von der Skybar sind einen Besuch wert.","Date of stay: August 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not up to Hilton standards","As there is not may option in Windhoek as this is a very small town, Hilton was my choice but clearly too many things wrong with hotel, staff are friendly but they wont go the extra mile for use us always a complication, had a problem in my feet could not walk a lot requested to change for a room closer o the elevator, the issue was escalated to 20 people before being allocated a closer room.Clear the hotel is old and needs updates carpets and other part, looks like part of the hotel was going to renovation but not sure.Another point for improvement would be for the kitchen, they use cheap ingredients in the food and it feel for example the eggs Benedict as my favorite I always asked but it tasted cheap margarine and vinegar so need an improvement there.Definitely too expensive and not leaving up to the standards for Hilton, better to try the other Chinese hotel just across the street","Date of stay: November 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Fairly Typical City Centre Hilton","Intending to just spend one night in Windhoek, we chose the Hilton as it appeared to be reasonably easy to find after a night time drive from Windhoek airport. Finding the hotel is fairly easy, as it is on the main road in to Windhoek from the airport and it's an unmistakable building, however getting there was something else, until you read the plate beneath the 'No right Turn' sign which says  'Apart for Guests'. Parking is then in an underground carpark.We struggled to get any service at the roof top bar, although there were some other guests sitting at the bar with drinks, so we went downstairs and whilst the drinks service was very good, it took well over half an hour for a club sandwich and a plate of chips to be served. The room was very clean and comfortable, as was the bed. Breakfast was very good, with a fine choice of fruit, cereals, pastries and hot items.","Date of stay: August 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Luxurious and charming","When we first arrived to Namibia we were all ready to dive into the wilderness of the country, sleeping wherever we could, exploring traditional places and cultures... Our stop at the hilton hotel was merely for convenience purposes, so we arrived at the hotel with no expectations  whatsoever simply exhausted from the 13 hour trip we'd just been through. The welcome was wonderful, the service was polite and helpful. They had upgraded us to another room due to our hhonnors club card and I must say it was the most asthetic and comfortable room I have ever stayed in.We had dinner at the hotel (they tend to offer two options: the buffet and normal menu) and the food was good. It was refined and tasty although that was only for certain dishes.We also had to spend 1 more night there on the way back. This time things were a bit more chaotic however, it was still pretty good even though the service lacked the usual motivation.It was a pleasant experience bearing in mind that we did not expect such luxury during our trip, the atmosphere managed to suit out worn-out conditions pretty well.","Date of stay: March 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good hotel in central Windhoek.","Very good hotel in central business district of Windhoek. The room was spacious, well appointed, quiet. Comfy bed. Large bathroom (a little too integrated with the room - looks nice but perhaps not super practical when sharing a room...)Great pool area. Nice restaurant.Totally my fault - I accidentally booked the wrong date (by one day) phoned the hotel to get that cancelled even if it was not refundable - within 5 minutes of making the booking - but they refused to refund that booking. I understand it was my fault - but I was hoping for a little flexibility and a refund given I realised my mistakes within 5 minutes and I was going to stay there the next night. It is not like the hotel was fully booked and they missed out.","Date of stay: March 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Aller Anfang ist schwer","Als Start unser Reise durch Namibia sollte es das Hilton in Windhoek sein. Nach einem langem Flug wollten wir nur noch entspannen und abschalten. Es ist auch ein tolles Hotel mit einer sch√∂ner Dachterrasse von der aus man bei einem Glas Wein den Blick √ºber Windhoek geniessen kann. Die Zimmer sind gross und sauber, das Personal sehr nett und das Abendessen war auch sehr gut.Einziger Wermutstropfen war...wir hatten weit voraus √ºber Hilton Honors das Zimmer inklusive Fr√ºhst√ºck und Dinner gebucht. Und einen Tag vor unserem Abflug konnten wir uns noch das Zimmer √ºber die App aussuchen. Als wir aber im Hotel ankamen war unsere Reservierung anscheinend nicht da. Wir bekamen ein ganz anderes Zimmer. Auf Nachfrage, ob wir denn Fr√ºhst√ºck und Dinner im Preis mit drin h√§tten, wurden wir gross angeschaut.  Erst als ich die Reserierung in der Hilton Honors App vorzeigte, kam Bewegung rein. Pl√∂tzlich bekamen wir ein anderes Zimmer und es wurde gesagt, dass man bei unsere Buchung hinterlegen w√ºrde, dass das Essen inklusive ist. Es hat am n√§chsten Tag zwar alles bei der Abrechnung geklappt, aber trotzdem blieb dieser Wermutstropfen.","Date of stay: February 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not very African","It was  a standard Hilton, though I guess quite new as everything was in good condtion . Arrived with our tour group from the airport and had to wait for about 1.5 hours until our rooms were ready .They did  give us (free)coffee etc but my husband just wanted to catch upon his sleep after an overnight flight and I just wantted to get out there and look round .It was a tad frustrating and the rest  of our 20 strong party didn't arrive  until  much later so I would have thought it should have been possible to have our rooms ready  .It 's very well located(Windhoek is small enough to walk around) though I was quite amused that the (5) ladies behind reception had trouble marking its location on a map for me .Totally unecessary as you can see it from all over the city  I did wonder why they had 5 reception staff and presumably not enough chambermaids ..  Its about 15 mins  walk from the 'Gingerbread' church (beautiful and I got a free organ recital) and the vast memorial to the 'father of Nambia' which houses the museum Ate somewhere else so can't comment on dinner. Breakfast was probably the best we had in Namibia . Staff very courteous and definitey had benefited from training delivered by an international chain.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ok, but I expected more ","Stayed here on my first night and my last night of the trip. It was ok, but given the comparative price, and five star status, I was disappointed. Room was nice enough, with air con, tv, shower and bath. Both times I had problems with check in, and staff couldn‚Äôt find my booking (but found the others in my group). WiFi was apparently free, but could only be obtained if you put in your credit card details. I queried with staff, and said I didn‚Äôt want to do this, but was told not to worry about it, and that any charges would be refunded on check out. This sounds ridiculous to me, and I would not be putting in my credit card for a free service, just so I could be ‚Äòrefunded‚Äô later. Not what I expect from a Hilton. Rooftop pool was lovely. Had a gym with a great view, but one of the treadmills just spontaneously stopped a couple of times, which was dangerous. Member of staff came in whilst I was on it and told me not to use that one as it stuck often!! There was no sign on the machine, despite staff clearly knowing there was a problem. Also, the gym door gave me a static shock every time I went in. Breakfast had potential to be great; lots of choice and lovely tasty food. However, staff took ages to seat us even though there were free tables, and the first day we had to ask for coffee three times before it eventually arrived a long time afterwards. Plates, bowls, glasses all ran out and took ages to be replaced. On my second stay, the clock radio (which had the wrong time on it) regularly made static noises all night, which was irritating. Not worth the extra money, and not as good as previous Hilton‚Äôs I have stayed at.","Date of stay: November 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Finally a very very good place to stay in NA","After 3 weeks in NA we were soooo happy to finally find a place where the staff is friendly and smiling, the beds are comfortable (not hard as hell), the food is (finally) a la carte and is very good, good wine, a good pool, and last but not least the breakfast is incredible. Finally finally a choice of bread, after 3 weeks of only toast and some strane pink sausage. The only thing we didn't find was smoked salmon and champagne, but the rest is worth flying for!

"Great hotel but slow staff","This is the best hotel in Windhoek, albeit somewhat pricey.  Great rooms and facilities and perfect location. Only problem is the consistently lame and slow front desk staff and sometimes slow/forgetful service (like having to ask for coffee at breakfast 3 times before actually receiving it, check-in taking 10 minutes, check-out taking forever, printers not working and them being unable to produce invoices etc.)","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice hotel but a smokey smell","I stayed here for 2 days while dealing with Namibian Home affairs, its the perfect location for anyone needing to be in the CBD or suburbs. The CBD is a short walk away so no need to worry about parking etc. If you need to get out north then the main roads run right past the hotel so going north is easy, getting out south or west is just as easy and so is east towards the airport.Breakfast was great, service was very courteous, from check in to check out.I had two complaints during my stay, the first was that I wondered if I had been given a smoking room, I actually called down to reception the minute I walked into he room. It had the old smoke smell, I was informed that all rooms are non smoking. I have no idea what that was then...The second, on my previous trip to Windhoek I mistakenly picked a hotel without a pool, this time I was going to be sure that after a day of running after Home affairs I wanted to have a swim.Just my luck, the pool was closed for renovations during my stay..Its a very nice hotel, nice location, stunning views of Windhoek.","Date of stay: March 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Wifi ain't the best in the room and you need to be either in the lobby or club room for the best signal.  The food was really good!  Just a pity the waiters let the chef down.  It is ok value for money and the best Windhoek has to offer.  The roof top is stunning for sunset drinks and offers great views of the city.

"Nice place to stay in the centre of Windhoek","The hotel is well located with the whole city centre within walking distance. The building is just a few years old, but one shouldn't look to closely if everything is in good shape. The room was quite big with an open bathroom and a comfortable bed, but without slippers and a bathrobe. Wifi is free for members of the Hilton loyalty programme and worked well at all times. I liked the rich breakfast buffet as well as the rooftop bar that gives a great view over the city. Some staff members were  nice and did a good job, indeed, but all in all the staff is not really noteworthy. The price for my stay was in line with the reputation of the hotel brand and the service level, though certainly not a bargain.","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Awesome First Experience","We stayed at the Hilton in Windhoek for our first anniversary and the overall experience was great. We arrived late Friday afternoon on the 1st of July and we were welcomed warmly by the staff and check in was easy because we only had to collect the key because we had already checked in online. We pretty much stayed at the hotel and did not go ou tmuch and we loved how the hotel have a variety of entertainment on site. We loved the Skybar (the view is to die for at night), Ekipa restaurant had a very interesting buffet and menu and also excellent wine selection. The staff were very friendly and attentive. Breakfast is a delight! Really loved the fresh juice bar and fruit smoothies. Room service was great too and the pizza we ordered was sooo goood! I mostly loved the stay and my only complaint was we never had water bottles in our room when we checked in they only put them in the next day.  After house keeping had cleaned up on Saturday they did not immediately make the bed we had to call them to do it (but the lady did say w=she was waiting on the sheets to be ironed). Other than that we loved our stay and we look forward to the next time we go back!

It's lasting well and still feels new.The rooftop bar is definitely worth a visit, particularly if you can be there for the incredible (though rather quick at this latitude) sunset. There is a pool at the rooftop bar, too.The staff and service are very good and attentive.The rooms and bathrooms are large and well-fitted, with good soundproofing and quiet rooms for a good nights sleep.However, the pillows are rather thin and are of the European type where all the stuffing seems to escape to the ends. (I did not ask the hotel if they had any other pillows on request.)The bathroom in the particular room type we stayed in has a frosted glass window from the outside of the building, to the shower enclosure. A lot of light comes in here, and because the bathroom is open plan, the room is quite bright at night, and there is no way of blocking the light out. This is in a deluxe room at the corner of the building, and the layout has been the same with the same problem on both occasions we've stayed. If you are light-sensitive you may want to check at reception (I am not light-sensitive, but I did notice it being unusually bright.)We didn't use the spa on this occasion for any treatment, but did have a massage on a previous visit, again a very good experience.The hotel has extremely fast and reliable wifi, which was useful.","Date of stay: May 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"MR","The hotel needs to live to its stated service provision values.

"Hotel is nice, service hit or miss","This is definitely the nicest hotel in Windhoek, but I am not sure it's worth the trouble.   IT was a bit shabby if you looked at anything closely and the service was SUPER spotty.  In some cases it was great - smooth checkin, nice bellman.   Other cases the ball was dropped repeatedly.   We learned in our short stay in Windhoek that people will readily agree to help or do something, but they don't always mean it.  It happened several times, not just here, so it's something to keep in mind.","Date of stay: March 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Love the sky bar!","Perfectly located in the middle of Windhoek.  Rooms are spacious, very clean and comfortable with good views of the surrounding area.

"Convenient location but poor business facility","The Hilton is quite centrally located with all the relevant stuff you need for a good night's rest. The breakfast is good and served at a decent time.  What is most disappointing is the quality of the Wi-fi. I would not mind adding R200 to my room rate to just have easily accessible Wi-fi. Instead here, you pay per hour! and the voucher doesnt work the first time. You must just grin and bear it having to go up and down to reception (because they wont come to your room) and ask for re-issue.","Date of stay: February 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Full luxury!","The Hilton Windhoek is a beautiful hotel. It is located in the center of the city, but one can have a great time without ever leaving the property.We had a large and lovely room that spoiled us. Warming rack for the towels, big bath tub, luxurious bed, and power outlets for South Africa, Europe, and Australia.The rooftop pool is narrow but warm as bathwater. Also on that same floor is a fitness center and executive lounge. The lounge is comfortable with two levels, It has lots of tables and upholstered chairs, computers (one of which is attached to a printer), a supply of fruit and nuts always available, and printed sheets with news of the day from various nations. We saw UK, Portugal, France, Germany, and USA.We ate at the hotel's restaurant, Ekipe. It serves a buffet with a variety of choices, some of them typically Numibian, others more international in scope. The buffet includes a dessert bar with many choices. The kids were in heaven and particularly delighted by the ""pot o' gold"" dessert. It is a dark chocolate pot with chocolate mousse inside.The room came with complimentary breakfast, also served in Ekipe. It had all the foods you would expect and a few more local delicacies, such as fresh granadilla (it's a fruit).The staff was friendly and helpful and always happy to make our experience better.","Date of stay: December 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Excellent hotel and extraordinary service","It was my first trip to Windhoek and the stay at the Hilton Hotel was a positive experience. The hotel is located in the city center and the rooms are large, comfortable and clean. The staff is very friendly and professional and I would like to specially mention Anna Asser who was very friendly and extremely helpful. She went out of her way to help me with check-in, printing of important documents urgently and other issues. I would like to commend her as an example of a staff member who went beyond the call of duty to help. I will be in Namibia in February and definitely plan to go back to the Hilton. I will not hesitate to recommend the Hilton to friends, family and colleagues.","Date of stay: November 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not to International standard expected of a Hilton","Severely disappointed by my recent stay, and will certainly not return: - I made my booking in March 2015, and specifically stated non smoking on my booking, yet when I arrived at 16.00, I was told there were no non smoking rooms left. Surely a room should have been allocated with my booking? I was offered to wait in the executive lounge, however no one could tell me how long I would have to wait. Having travelled down from Ongava, this was not appealing, so I took a smoking room - which was awful.- Wifi was atrocious. Tried to free wifi access in the lobby area, but no success, and I was told by a girl at reception that the wifi was down. Tried to access the paid wifi from the room, and this didn't work either, I was told a call could be put through to the Internet Service Provider so they could manually connect my device. This is again not acceptable. I should not have to speak to an ISP to access a service the hotel provides. If it doesn't work, don't offer it. And if you want to have it as something to offer, make sure you get good service.- Breakfast on the whole was good, as it is a Buffett, but there is no coffee stand to help yourself, so you are at the mercy of the very slow wait staff. I requested a coffee when I sat down, and didn't see the waitress again...and finished my breakfast without any coffee being brought. It was not very full either, so the wait staff need to be retrained on international levels of service.- Finally there is construction going on next door to build a Hilton Garden Inn. There was no mention on check in (or before when booking as a warning in case customers would prefer another location). Anyway a word of warning, the construction starts at 6.30, so if you are in holiday, I would suggest you ask for a room that does not overlook the construction site.","Date of stay: November 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sch√∂nes Hotel, unfreundliches Personal ","Unsere erste Eindruck war eine gro√üe Entt√§uschung. Wir haben 1,5 Stunden auf unser Zimmer gewartet, obwohl wir um 13:20 im Hotel waren, also nicht sehr fr√ºh, so dass das Zimmer noch nicht frei gewesen w√§re. Ausserdem muss ich betonen, das niemand vom Personal gel√§chelt hat, alle waren sehr unfreundlich. Endlich haben wir unseren Zimmerschl√ºssel bekommen,. Das azimmer war ein raucherhimmer. Es hat unglaublich schlecht gerochen. Als wir uns beschwe haben, sagte man uns, dass sie das Zimmer sauber machen k√∂nnten mit Stsubsaugee. Nat√ºrlich haben wir das abgelehnt. Dann bekamen wir ein Zimmer auf den h√∂heren Etagen. Es war ein kostenloses Upgrade. Das neue Zimmer wae sch√∂n, gross und sauber. Man h√§tte uns am Anfang fragen m√ºssen, ob wir Raucher sind. Ansonsten waren wir zufrieden.","Date of stay: September 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Carefree Business","A great place to stay and be looked after so that I can focus on the important things that I need to.

"Disappointing staff- problems all around","First impression of the building and check in we thought it was going to be fine.  Given an upgrade for Diamond Status, which was a nice start.  We had booked 2 massages 45 days in advance.  Written confirmation from Spa Manager Virginia.  When we arrived, in much need of a massage after all the international travel, learned that only one massage would be available as the other employee had quit.  We had not been notified so we could make other arrangements or take a different time slot.  That was really disappointing. So we went to the executive lounge, which had several unsupervised children in there alone.  Ok. That is strange.  We had a burger at the bar which was below average.  The next morning the bill was under our door. Charges from the bar on the bill which didn't belong to us. We immediately notified front desk to recheck the bills we had been charged.  They called back to say they had removed the charges that weren't ours.  When we went to check out, we saw that the wrong charges were still on our bill and the charges that were ours were not on our bill.  We were still be over charged by about N$330.  We waited and waited at the front desk for resolution.  Charges coming on and off and still after 30 minutes it couldn't get resolved. Eventually we had to leave for the airport and couldn't wait any longer. They said they would correct. But the larger amount still ended up on our credit card.  Won't be staying here again.   Prepare yourself for disappointments and frustrations if you decide to stay.","Date of stay: December 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice hotel - some rude staff","This is everything you expect from a Hilton and it delivers. Great location and facilities - the roof top pool and terrace was great. Very nice luxurious quiet rooms. However the staff at the Skybar restaurant were extremely rude. The service on check in was fantastic as were all other staff members - and therefore quite different to the service at the pool bar. I'm sure just a rogue member of staff that is spoiling everyone else's hard work on making it such a good experience. Apart from that though - a great place to start/end your Namibian holiday.","Date of stay: November 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good start and finish in Namibia","We stayed there at the beginning and at the end of our three weeks holidays in Namibia. The hotel is conveniently located in the center of Windhoek. It has nice rooms and bathrooms and is a perfect spot to get you going after a long flight. There is a nice rooftop bar and swimming pool. It would be perfect for laps, unfortunately the water is overheated. Also, it tends to be overcrowded on week-ends. The breakfast is great, with a large variety of cold and hot food, fresh juices, fruit, pastry, etc. The wifi is slow and expensive. The parking is free, but you have to ask for your exit ticket at the reception desk. The staff is very helpful in making diner reservation.","Date of stay: September 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Back to the same hotel, not the same experience though ...","I revisited Hilton Windhoek after 1 year. Of course it remains the best hotel in the city, no doubt, but... Yes but... in 1 year the shine had started to fade away... The rooms, the cleanses, the food, not like 1 year ago, when I first visited and it was just opened. I had to change the room, cause there was no hot water (although the staff was helpful and trying to fix it), the dinner quality was average both nights that I had dinner, the breakfast was abundant but... The espresso though in the coffee shop in the entrance floor was great (for a European having a decent espresso is crucial... :-))  The internet, I paid like 12 Euro per day for internet, and there is no free area anywhere in the hotel. I will come again next year, hopefully, and I hope I will not be disappointed.","Date of stay: May 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I personally feel it is the best hotel on Namibia. Will any time recommend especially for business trips.

"Central and Convenient for Business","Stayed at Hilton Windhoek for almost two months, and as checked in and out for circa three times I stayed in different rooms, while in the same category. Overall is a good business hotel, The hotel is new and the rooms are spacious, with plenty of light and with a very good desk, where you can put your computer, printer and even some paper files. Here and there you can find some maintenance problems, but mostly related with low-quality material on construction. Air-con is good and room design is very modern and confortable. On the top floor there is a small but convenient pool with a bar, as well as a relatively complete gym and a small Spa where you can find a relaxing massage (the gym was the reason I chose the hotel). The staff is VERY friendly although sometimes lacks a little experience. Other great advantage is that is located downtown, on walking distance to banks, malls, shops of every kind. One of the best business travelers options in Windhoek. If the internet were free of charge I would rate Hilton Windhoek as ""Excellent"".","Date of stay: April 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very nice hotel....internet is highway robbery","I stayed 7 nights and personally found the staff incredibly friendly and helpful, despite reading several reviews to the contrary.Admittedly I had never stayed in a Hilton before so I do not have a good reference to compare this hotel to other Hilton's, but I thought the room was very nice, the lobby was beautiful, and the restaurants/bars had good food.One thing that I did find annoying is the elevators.  You could easily find yourself waiting a handful of minutes for an elevator, as they often passed right by my floor even when I was trying to go in the same direction.My last issue, and it is a big one, is the internet.  I know all Hilton's charge for it, but the price is excessive.  N170 per day!  This needs to change!","Date of stay: February 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Typisches Hiltonhotel","F√ºr einen Kongress wurde ich vom Organisator ins Hilton Windhoek einquartiert. Normalerweise ziehe ich in Afrika eher stilvolle lokale Unterk√ºnfte vor, muss aber sagen, dass das Hilton sehr zentral gelegen und gut konzipiert ist. Das Hotel verf√ºgt zudem √ºber sch√∂n eingerichtete Zimmer. Die Bars und Lounges sind gem√ºtlich, im Restaurant habe ich nur gefr√ºhst√ºckt. Die Preise sind nat√ºrlich √ºberdurchschnittlich hoch, dennoch wird z.B. die Dachterrasse mit ihrer Bar intensiv auch von der v.a. jungen einheimischen Bev√∂lkerung genutzt.","Date of stay: October 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"F√ºr den Sundowner","Die Hilton Rooftop Bar eignet sich hervorragend f√ºr einen Sundowner. Faire Preise f√ºr die Location und ansonsten ein gigantisch, toller Ausblick. Man muss hierzu kein Gast sein. Die Bar auf der Terrasse ist zwar nicht sonderlich gro√ü, aber es geht ja auch darum den Sonnenuntergang genie√üen zu k√∂nnen.","Date of stay: February 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A disappointing Stay","We stayed at this hotel between 12 December and 20 December 2013 and it was not a good experience.We were in an Executive Room- but it lacks bathroom and toilet privacy; terrible if you have a visitor and also if one uses the facilities when the other person is sleeping.One night we could not sleep for a couple of hours because of a noise from the shower, probably because it was in use in the adjacent room. There is constant noise from the lift throughout the night.The lighting is poor and the room is semi dark.Though Wi-Fi is advertised at the Hotel's website, it is not free and I was quoted N1000+ for a week's use and so I had to do without. So effectively there is no Internet except for a shared computer in the lobby for all guests.My wife tendered for a currency change GB¬£90 and was given a receipt for 90Euros, we made several attempts to get this rectified until we had to give up. I tried a couple of times to change money and found they did not have enough local money. The staff also keep telling you that their rate is very low.We ate breakfast and Dinner there. The meals are boring monotonous and not great, the last breakfast we asked for fried egg and we were given one egg each. Sometimes room service food is brought in a warmer and sometimes it is just placed on a trolley. If you want room service breakfast you have to ring for the order card every time. For three days the hotel Restaurant had no soft drinks. The tea bags in the rooms are rationed to one bag a person in case one wants to use the tea making facilities in the room.Over all, the staff seem to lack proper training although they are very cheerful and try to be helpful.This was a trip arranged by our children as a present for our 40 wedding anniversary and it would break their heart if we told them of our experience. This is not the Hilton service and facilities I am familiar with.","Date of stay: December 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Beautiful hotel, terrible staff","Spent 2 days while on business in Namibia. Found the hotel absolutely beautiful and everything was brilliant from check in to stay, however after my stay I got an email from the Manager stating there was damage to the TV. On further investigation, it seems there was physical damage which was not observed at the time of my check-out, but later in the day. It was obvious that the damage was done post my check out however I was horribly harassed and abused by the Director of Operations, TEUN ENGBERS. This went on for weeks and my company had to get involved. Never before has this happened to me!","Date of stay: July 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The Best","We had to find a night's accommo in Windhoek due to rescheduling of flights not fitting in with prearranged arrangements, so decided on something central.  It was a complete surprise for although Hilton's have a certain similarity, this was something out of the box.  For a start the design was open and had a good feel, but it all worked and the staff were fabulous.  Nothing was a problem and they obviously loved what they were doing - it came through just talking to them.  There is a fabulous roof pool-top bar which serves light meals and you can view marvelous sunsets over the city.  Their main restaurant was one of the best and for Hilton standards was very well priced.  Rooms are extremely well appointed and once you have worked out all the little buttons, everything  opens & shuts ... plus they have a gorgeous bath to soak away that safari dust.","Date of stay: May 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sch√∂nes Hotel mit Schw√§chen im Service","Das Hilton Windhoek liegt mitten im Stadtzentrum von Windhoek an der Independence Avenue. Alle Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten sind tags√ºber gut Fuss zu erreichen, man sollte zu diesem Zeitpunkt aber besser kein Mietauto mehr haben, da Parken eher teuer und umst√§ndlich ist. Die Zimmer sind gross und modern mit grossem Badbereich und separater Dusche. Der Poolbereich auf dem Dach ist gerade nach einer langen Namibia-Rundreise ein echtes Plus, auch wenn der Pool selbst mit 28 Grad eher Thermalbad-Temperatur aufweist. Echte Schw√§chen hat das Hotel, wie beireits in anderen Reviews beschrieben, vor allem beim Service: Der Check-In scheint sehr kompliziert und dauert unn√∂tig lange. Lange Schlangen sind die Folge. Auch die Tatsache, dass Wi-Fi hier noch extra bezahlt werden muss, ist meiner Meinung nach lange nicht mehr zeitgem√§√ü, solche Selbstverst√§ndlichkeiten sollten bereits bei der Kalkulation der Zimmerrate ber√ºcksichtigt werden. Auch f√ºr das Fr√ºhst√ºck findet man entgegen des Aufdrucks auf dem Room Service Menu beim Auschecken dann noch eine zus√§tzliche ""Tray-Fee"" auf seiner Rechnung. Hierbei geht es weniger um die H√∂he der Fee (wir hatten auch zu dem h√∂heren Preis bestellt) als die Tatsache, dass diese zahlreichen, immer wieder versteckten Charges schlichtweg aergerlich und damit geeignet sind, den an sich sehr positiven Eundruck des Hotels zu besch√§digen. Gleichwohl w√ºrden wir das Hilton nach wie vor als gutes Hotel empfehlen.","Date of stay: April 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice hotel but not without faults","Stayed here for 1 night on our 1st night in Namibia, we didn't get off to a great start as I had pre-booked an airport pick up with the hotel that didn't show up. For a chain with the reputation as the Hilton I was very surprised at this oversight. It's also quite daunting to arrive in Africa and then have to try and arrange a taxi. Anyway the hotel were very apologetic and upgraded our room to compensate. Apart from that it's a great hotel, the rooms were spacious and luxurious and a real highlight was the fantastic roof top bar and pool. Had a great atmosphere and seemed very popular with the locals. We ate at the restaurant which was also very good. For 1 night I was happy with my choice of hotel. I would only suggest to re-confirm airport pickups just before you set off on your journey.","Date of stay: March 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First rate hotel - visit marred by one instance of poor customer service","First the positives: This hotel in in a great location, close to downtown, craft markets, restaurants and the small downtown mall. The staff were friendly, attentive and professional, particularly in the Skybar and the Coffee lounge which are both excellent facilities. Food quality at breakfast and dinner was above average for hotel fare. The craft store in the foyer has some interesting things on sale at reasonable prices.  Now the negatives: The wi-fi internet provision is expensive and slow. There is no free service anywhere in the hotel.  There was a mess up with our airport transportation reservation and the reception staff, including someone we think was the reception supervisor, responded really badly, telling us repeatedly that it was  'on the way' when it wasn't, leaving us to resolve matters, after 20  minutes waiting, by commandeering a local taxi. Screw-ups will happen in the best run establishments.  How they recover from them determines the lasting impression of customer service, and outstanding recovery starts with 'Mea Culpa' and honesty.","Date of stay: March 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great Hotel","I traveled to Windhoek, Namibia for the first time in Oct.  I stayed for 3 week in the Windhoek Hilton.  I have to say it was the highlight of all my stays in Africa.  The hotel clean, modern and loaded with amenities.  On the 9th floor, which a roof top, has a really nice lap pool.  In addition it has a roof top bar with great views of the city of Windhoek.  Also a good fitness center and spa.  The fitness center has several of the ellipticals and bikes with a gym with weights.  No free weights.  Also the Executive Lounge is on the 9th floor and has two levels with commanding views.  The staff are excellent providing anything you need.  I do have to said they ran out of Jack Daniels which I prefer for two weeks.  The wine and other selections were provided.  The food provide was very good.  I can't say enough about the Executive Lounge staff they truly made our stay exceptional.Breakfast was provided in the restaurant and had many choices to include a full cooked breakfast.  Staff were wonderful but had to get their attention for refills or coffee.  Half way during our stay they changed the hours of service from 0630 to 0700 in the morning.  This was not relied to us and we showed up at 0645 and it was closed. This was an issue as we had to depart at 0730 and change did not provide adequate time for a breakfast.  The Hotel is very convenient to all of the shops with in 2-3 blocks.  This includes all of the Namibia arts shops, markets, restaurants and clubs.I would highly recommend this hotel if you travel to Windhoek, Namibia","Date of stay: October 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Mediocre","How on earth this hotel can have a 5 star rating is beyond me. Admittedly I have never stayed at the hotel, but I have attended functions and spoken with several other people who attended similar functions independently of me. The consensus: Service, food and organisation is mediocre at best. The prices for drinks are ridiculously inflated, and only a few years after completion the hotel is already showing signs of wear & tear.Then there is the parking area. Yes, I know it doesn‚Äôt actually belong to the Hilton group, but seriously?! With the main entrances adjacent to the parking lot, the implication is most definitely that it should be associated with the hotel. I am ashamed every time I have to use that parking lot. What will foreigners think of us Namibians when they see the potholes, the broken terrain, the mess?","Date of stay: September 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A great hotel for Windhoek","The Windhoek Hilton is a very well appointed hotel that stands apart from most options in Windhoek. The room was modern with a good range of fittings, large bath and comfortable bed. While the desk offers a suitable work area, I caught my knees on the sharp edged drawers a few times. There is a general aura of exclusivity to the hotel that is less evident from the outside. Staff are friendly and service is overall excellent.","Date of stay: June 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Best hotel in Windhoek","I stayed in the Hilton for the first time and I was really satisfied. As it is new the interior is very nice and clean. The location of the hotel is also perfect as it is in the center of the city.Also perfect is the ""Sky-Bar"" on the roof top. You can have nice drinks and snacks there and enjoy the sunset after your day. Seems that also some local people are coming there to relax.A little bit bad is the slow service in the other bars of the hotel. Took quite some time to get a waiter to the table. This should be improved.Also the pool (again on the roof top) is a little bit small. If you would like to swim you have to be alone. Otherwise you could have trouble with avoiding collisions.All in all I will be back in this hotel when I will be back in Windhoek.","Date of stay: May 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great property, but the service is a bit raw","Very nice property - centrally located and at a walking distance away from some good malls. The slightly elevated location and short buildings around the hotel make for great sunset views from the rooftop bar and pool. The coffee shop is nice, albeit offering limited choices.Now for the negatives: I am a vegetarian - and veggie food options were virtually non-existent. Had to survive on juices and boiled vegetables most of the time. But if you are non-vegetarian, you will not be disappointed. The other aspect was the service: the staff tend to be a bit cold and lethargic in attending to you. I was actually left waiting for ~ 20 minutes just to get a cinnamon bun at the coffee shop!  They definitely need to train their staff a lot better if they need to justify their top-dollar rates.","Date of stay: February 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This does not combine with the rest of the Namibians good education. In the hotel restaurant we asked for some beverages after having ordered our meals, but to serve soft drinks took almost a half hour. My mobile charger broke and i had to ask for a wake up call in the morning in order to get our flight out from the airport very early, as well as breakfast box due to the time of departure.

"Something wrong here","Service while pleasant generally poor and slow, seemed like Friday night in the bar the managers were hanging out looking very dictatorial unnecessarily ordering staff around.  Had a room service issue (took over 50 mins to arrive), wrong order, and wanted to send the order back but the staff member said if I sent it back he would have to pay, terrible practice and when I asked to see a manager to resolve, seemed like genuine fear. Hardly saw any management around the hotel for the week apart from in the bar on Friday night, shame as good location, rooms ok, lovely views of sunset from the rooftop bar‚Ä¶.","Date of stay: August 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Modern hotel, nice ambience, poor service.","First Impressions are very important. Our group of 4 arrived at the hotel around 7pm in the evening, very excited to be spending our first night in Namibia, and also very excited for the beginning of our safari/tour through the country. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted and brought to the front desk for checking in. That is where first impression should have been a good one, however, it was not. The Front Desk agent was a trainee and was working with another woman who appeared to be his manager. We provided him with all four passports and gave the name that room should have been booked under. After a one second glance at the screen the manager looks back at us and says very very rudely, ""No. We have no rooms under that name we are all booked."". (not exactly something you want to experience on your first night of a tour. After a brief discussion with her, we had to instruct her to recheck for our names, and try each of the names on the 4 different passports that she already had in her hand. Then she actually refused to instruction and said ""no, we do not have any rooms"" I then had to show her that it is possible the room may have been booked under one of the other names on the passport and then she says to us ""Ok, but I have only two rooms booked for the four of you"" We were traveling as two couples on safari, and did not understand how anyone working in hospitality for a company known worldwide could not put two and two together to figure out we only needed 2 rooms. So that was our great first impression. The room itself was new modern clean, and pretty much everything you should expect from a new hilton.  After settling in we decided to go have a drink at the roof top bar. Unfortunately this was another place where we received poor service. Finally we figured that we would head downstairs to the Bar/Restaurant that has a great singer on Thursday nights, and it had a nice atmosphere. It took almost twenty minutes for a server to even acknowledge us, even though there may have been about fifteen servers running around and behind the bars and chatting with each other. The service here was extremely poor and I am amazed that there was absolutely no form of management that was leading by example. Unfortunately we had to return to this hotel for our last night in Namibia until we returned from South Africa. The service was slightly better but still way below par compared to any of the lodges, hotels, and resorts that we stayed at. The airport hotel in Doha, for a good four hours of sleep, had better service than this hilton.","Date of stay: August 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lovely","The customer service, rooftop bar, and the size of the rooms was the best part of this stay. I was solo in Windhoek waiting to take a trip to Sossusvlei and I stayed here for the start and end of my journey. First, the location is good. It looks like it's on an isolated hill but in reality it's just a 5 minute walk to the ""downtown"" area where there are restaurants, drinks, shops and a post office. There's also a casino at the bottom of the hotel and to the side of it is an arts & crafts expo where you can buy lots of crafts. Second, they have a rooftop bar with really great views of the small city of Windhoek. I' just go for the fries and to see the sunset. There's a bit of pretentious after work vibe and there's a pool, but I was fine drinking wine solo in my jeans as people around me were dressed up nicely. Third, the customer service. If you need anything, phone and they are right there. They guys who manage the doors and greet the clients are always friendly and ready to offer advice on how to get around and where to go. Even one guy walked me out back to show we a short cut to the post office. They make you feel wall taken care of,Fourth, the bed was huge and comfy. The room was huge. Prob. bigger than most NYC apartments and it had everything I needed.","Date of stay: November 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great! Hightly recommended","Really fantastic hotel - for both business and leisure travelers. The staff were attentive - perfect check-in, arranging our taxi's in the evenings and looking after us at the deck-bar. Rooms are modern and comfortable. Have been to other hotels in Windhoek - this will always be first choice going forward.For smoking, proper comfortable area catered for downstairs (although far from the bar)Not much more to say - highly recommend","Date of stay: March 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"4days at the Hilton","I arrived on Tuesday 10pm. My journey was slightly over 8hrs. I was tired and irritable. I needed my room key at the speed of lightening. Guess what the key doesn‚Äôt work! so I‚Äôve to pull my bags downstairs again and try validate the key again. A SECOND time and the key wasn‚Äôt working. The third time I was ready to walk out of the hotel and go to Avani Hotel.It‚Äôs now almost 11pm, my door won‚Äôt open without the duty managers key, I‚Äôve no TV remote and the sockets don‚Äôt work to charge my phone and laptop. I‚Äôm fed up, on requesting for a room change I‚Äôm quickly informed the hotel is full and my door cannot be repaired until the following day. I push all the movable furniture to door and fall asleep In the morning I go for breakfast and I need to acess my room before going to my meeting and they can‚Äôt find someone to open my DOOR.... another 30minutes the engineers arrive!So is there anything good about this hotel?1. At breakfast they have a juicer for fresh fruit and vegetables and you get a fantastic drink in a minute.2. Roof top bar with a fantastic view of Windhoek3. Restaurants within walking distance - I especially like an Italian one that has very good wine called SicilyWould I stay there again?I prefer Avani and that would be my 1st choice when in Windhoek!","Date of stay: December 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flawless experience","Having traveled all over Africa, I often tone down my expectations about what major international hotel brands will deliver. At the Hilton Windhoek, nothing could be further from the truth. World-class experience in every way, and one of the better Hiltons I've stayed at anywhere in the world.","Date of stay: April 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Outstanding service","I have stayed in Hiltons in various parts of the world but this has to be the best one so far. We had to wait a little while for our room but this was not problematic as we were upgraded and given access to the executive lounge.  We were kept up to date with the progress of the room clean. Once we got the room on the 7th floor it was large with a separate shower and bath. We had two double beds which was perfect as there were three of us.  We ended up eating what was called the light evening meal in the executive lounge which was very substantial and we didn't need to eat at the restaurant.Breakfast was outstanding with a huge choice of fruit, cereals and cooked foods both European and Namibian. We paid $N195 each which was value for money.We used the gym on the 9th floor which was perfectly adequate for our needs with CV machines, weights and stretch mats. We were given access codes for the wifi which was responsive.Parking was underground and secure.Although we were only spent one night here we would highly recommend a stay here.","Date of stay: December 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Staff is overwhelmed; hotel cuts corners to save","The hotel itself is nice enough and is very well located in Windhoek.  When we arrived, our rooms were not ready despite it being two hours after check-in time.  The staff failed to address this in any meaningful way despite numerous complaints.  Service in the hotel is generally slow and the staff appear overwhelmed and poorly trained.  The room is clean and comfortable, but the towels are yellowing and fraying; they do not smell fresh.  Despite an aircon control in the room, the aircon can in fact not be manually adjusted for each person's preference.  The management apparently controls it.","Date of stay: June 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"An embarrassment to the Hilton brand","Looked nice upon arrival.. fell apart soon after!Nice reception.Was placed in room 810, which smelled of sewer.  Management sent someone up to check, and confirmed that it smelled.They moved our bags to another room - but they never brought the new keys!  Took them 12 hours to change rooms in the system.Room service took 80 minutes for a dish that was only halfway complete. By far the worst dinner we have had in 2 months of travel in Africa. Many calls came through to the room - all hang-ups.  When I called to the front desk to inquire and block all calls to the room, they told me to take the phone off the hook! Knock at the door at 11:30pm.  They didn't have our room in the system (duh, they had changed our room!), and couldn't figure it out for room service billing. We were asleep! Couldn't it have waited?Shining star - Vivian, a true gentleman, staffing the executive lounge.No manager on duty the next morning. Voiced my concerns to the maintenance manager, who promised that the GM would write me (never did!).","Date of stay: August 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not what you think! Beware","The lobby and the restaurant look nice but the rooms are not 5 star. They are 2-3 star at the most. The rooms were not very clean and smelled a little. There was a break in the water lines contaminating the whole system and no one seemed concerned! We couldn't shower, brush our teeth, wash our face or eat anything that was washed or cooked with the water.  We had to ask for bottled water to at least brush our teeth. We had a room booked to stay there on our way out of the country 8 days later. I canceled it. It cost me double to book another hotel last minute but their lack of concern for bacteria in their water system made me wonder what other standards are so low???","Date of stay: August 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"No free WiFi","I was very angry during 10 days stay in Hilton. The high-class hotel should have open WiFi everywhere. But here you should pay ‚Äì per hour, day or week. Price is high, and if you don‚Äôt disconnect properly, you will pay a penalty (19 $). So, if you need WiFi for business communication, or just to be in touch with your family, go somewhere else.Also, people working at reception desk are totally incompetent ‚Äì they can‚Äôt convey any message, provide help, or something like this. A day before early departure for one day trip, a group of us asked for breakfast packages to be prepared at 6 am. In the morning there was a total mess ‚Äì nobody knew about these request. After a long quest they finally delivered our breakfasts, but without bags (sorry, we are out of bags!). So, we left without it.","Date of stay: February 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton Windhoek - scoring low on service in the restaurant","The hotel is nice and comfortable with spacious rooms, good beds and a beautiful roof top terass to sit an enjoy the sunset. That is what we did after a long travel from Europe arriving at the hotel early evening and being reassured when checking in that dinner was served until 1030pm - both a la cart√© and buffe.  Arriving at the restaurant at 0900 pm we were told that a la cart√© was no longer on and that we could have buffe only. A buffe where quite a few of the dishes were finished already. Even more frustrating was that some of the guests arriving after us were served a la cart√©.  After ordering from a promising wine list, we had to change our choice three times as the year of the wine chosen from the list was no longer available. We ended up by asking for cabernet sauvignon similar to our first choice and found out when paying the bill that we were charged almost 800 rand for the bottle. Our fist choice was priced at 300 but the waitress chose not to inform us about the high price of the wine she brougth instead. Not a very pleasant evening and start of our vacation.","Date of stay: December 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good stop off in and out of Namibia","Good Hilton standard hotel easy to find when driving into Windhoek from the airport.Friendly staff.Has a nice roof top bar which includes a pool and lounging/ sun bathing area.It was a Friday night when we arrived and the rooftop bar seemed something of the ‚Äò in place‚Äô for the local in crowd.That was all just fine.However part of the local scene seemed to be blasting out Afro hip hop/ rap music which presumably is popular with the local clientele or they wouldn‚Äôt be blasting it out.However for the more sedate elderly ‚Äòfuzzy daddies‚Äô such as myself it would have been nice to sit out on the roof in the warm evening having a few beers without being blasted and being able to hear enough to actually have a conversation with my companion.I have a suggestion.There are speakers all around the roof area.Why not just have the speakers in the bar area for the younger ‚Äò cool cats‚Äô and not have speakers in the area furthest from the bar so that the more mature punters ,such as myself,can enjoy a quiet drink.","Date of stay: March 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Could be in any city in the world","This feels like a Hilton you'd find in any number of world cities, and for a couple of quick overnights in between visits to other places, that was all I wanted and it served its purpose well. The rooftop bar is OK, but I'm guessing that if you're coming through Windhoek as a tourist you are on your way to or from any number of much more spectacular vistas than the Windhoek skyline. Proximity to the Independence Museum and a few malls was great.  I had the game medallions for dinner one night and they were delicious. One downside/caveat: there's no ATM on premises so I had to go to one on the street to pay my cab back to the airport, which was a bit dicey (though ultimately worked out fine.)","Date of stay: August 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Mucho que mejorar","Estuvimos dos noches hospedados, el d√≠a que llegamos a Namibia y el que nos fuimos.La primera vez todo se desarroll√≥ con normalidad y disfrutamos de una buena cena y una agradable velada durante una actuaci√≥n en directo de dos cantantes. La habitaci√≥n tambi√©n bien. Pero el √∫ltimo d√≠a todo se torci√≥: cuando llegamos, nos dijeron que el sistema se hab√≠a ca√≠do y nos tuvieron una hora y veinte minutos esperando para poder darnos habitaci√≥n. Despu√©s de ese tiempo, resulta que podr√≠amos haber hecho la reserva online. Bueno, la hicimos, nos dijeron que necesitaban otros veinte minutos y ante nuestras protestas, nos dieron una habitaci√≥n con cama doble pero preparada para un hu√©sped solo, asegur√°ndonos que ser√≠a provisional. Lo provisional se convirti√≥ en lo definitivo. Cuando requerimos hablar con la responsable de recepci√≥n, nos dijeron que estaba reunida y lo mismo pas√≥ a la ma√±ana siguiente cuando al ir a pagar insistimos en hablar de nuevo con ella. Huelga decir que nos quedamos all√≠ porque era el final de un largo viaje y ya est√°bamos demasiado cansados para buscar otra cosa.","Date of stay: February 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton Hotel mit leichten Abstrichen","Wir starteten unsere Namibia-Rundreise im Hilton. Wir wollen nach einem langen Flug immer ein standardisiertes Zimmer, deshalb Ketten-Hotel. Die Zimmer und der Standard entsprachen denn auch dem Erwarteten (gen√ºgend Platz, vern√ºnftiges Badezimmer, kein Schnickschnack).Bei der Ankunft liess man uns mit unserem Reiseb√ºro-Voucher eine gute halbe Stunde warten, bis dann die Aussage kam, ""die Reservation sei jetzt gefunden worden"".  Ein Getr√§nk oder eine Entschuldigung fehlte leider...Das Nachtessen im Restaurant war √ºberraschend gut. Normalerweise essen wir nicht im Hotel, aber da einige uns empfohlene Restaurants geschlossen hatten, kehrten wir ins Hotel zur√ºck und waren sehr zufrieden.Dass man f√ºr den WLAN-Empfang zahlen soll, ist f√ºr ein Hilton doch merkw√ºrdig.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There is a fresh vibe and energy. The standard room is fairly large with excellent space. The rooftop deck/sky bar/pool is fantastic.My only frustration was housekeeping. Things were perpetually skipped, however it wouldn't influence my decision on coming back at all.I got stuck in the lift before a big meeting and must say that the staff handled it professional.

I did not use it once during my stay and was lucky to have a bathtub too.  I have discussed with one of the cleaning lady and she told me they were 15 to maintain 300 rooms.

"Shocking","I think some needs to remind this hotel that they are in Hospitality.check in : slow....waited 20 minutes to be spoken to and checked in -there was only  1 other guest checking in at the time...i had to wave my arms so they could acknowledge and call someone from the back to assist.(the back office door opened and there seemed to be that everyone was hiding in the back office)Ver very expensive Hotel - you do not get what you pay for :Room - 1 towel no hand towels....finally housekeeping arrived 11pm and woke me up to give me the hand towels.mini Bar Fridge - had not been re stocked - was also a rotting salad in the bar fridge from the previous guest ... i guess the previous guest got away without paying for mini bar usage - hint to Hilton - you're losing money here.Mineral water bottle opened and replaced in fridge! toughest fillet and most expensive fillet steak i ever had the embarrassment to watch my guest eat very slow internet - 0.37Mbps download speed AND you have to PAY R185 or around $15USD PER DAY PER ROOM the rest of the globe Hotel internet is expected to be free of charge people on business book hotels where they can get good wifi.we co-sponsored an event at the very same Hilton Namibia hotel with several Vendor leaders in IT - I will definitely be taking our business elsewhere.We brought around 6-8 people to stay at the hotel and attend the event...all found it very poor.we had local Namibian guests that refused to come to the event as it was being held at Hilton...due to the overpricing and shocking service.....in the lounge areas we did not once actually get served coffee...one waiter complained to a guest about feet on the outside table but couldn't be asked to actually take an order and disapeared.of greatest concern was that after my complaints and requests to see manager - the Manager did not get back to me  about room issue - the IT manager did not get back to me regards IT and Internet issues.i found the staff generally unhelpful  and i was forced to pay the full bill as this was pre cleared on my credit card....apart from the fact that i could never get to speak to a manager.this is not a 5 star Hilton - looks fancy from outside but it stops there.i would certainly recommend one of the many other local Windhoek hotel options...for the price of Hilton Namibia you can get a much better experience at a local boutique guest house !","Date of stay: June 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

They had to call out the servicemen from the elevator installer and as the elevator has an exterior window and the sun was up it became rather hot encased in the square box! On this incident the staff were not very concerned and I was mostly ignored. I had to try to prize the door slightly apart to find out what was going on and then they were not all that forthcoming. Apparently this had also happened the day before. As the title says hopefully a teething problem and maybe it's all in good order now - I hope so. We will be staying again.","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A Decent Hotel in a Developing City","I read with interest some of the reviews of this hotel and some I found somewhat pompous and unfair. We stayed in the Hilton for just one night on our arrival in Namibia. There is no doubt that Namibia is developing its tourist industry and I congratulate Hilton for establishing a presence here. The hotel appears to be well run, it is comfortable and the food on offer is good. What it does lack is that professional touch which should come with time. I agree the bathroom arrangements are quirky - but one should lighten up and go with it!","Date of stay: September 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Alles in Ordung","Wir haben zwei N√§chte im Hotel verbracht. Zimmer, Bar und Fr√ºhst√ºck sind ausgezeichnet. Ein Minuspunkt gibt es f√ºr das kostenpflichtige W-LAN, was auch nicht g√ºnstig ist. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Reisenden hatten wir nicht unbedingt das Gl√ºck, das hilfbereiteste und freundlichste Personal zu erleben-kann passieren. F√ºr den Beginn einer Namibia-Reise sicher ein gutes Hotel, um anzukommen.","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hotel moderne et bien situ√©","H√¥tel r√©cent bien situ√© au c≈ìur de la ville de Windhoek. Nous y avons s√©journ√© 2 nuits. Une nuit √† notre arriv√©e √† Windhoek et une nuit avant notre d√©part.Le personnel est tr√®s accueillant et tr√®s aimable. Les chambres sont grandes et modernes comme ce que nous attendons d‚Äôun Hilton.Un important point n√©gatif existe pourtant. Il vient du Club Los Cubanos install√© en bas de l‚Äôh√¥tel. Ce Club nous assomme de Music et surtout de Bass toute la nuit quand vous avez le malheur d‚Äôavoir une chambre du c√¥t√© ou il est situ√©. Nous √©tions la seconde nuit dans la chambre 516 au 5√®me √©tage,  c‚Äô√©tait le vendredi 23 Mai et nous n‚Äôavons pas pratiquement dormi de la nuit. C‚Äôest bien dommage car cet h√¥tel ne m√©rite pas d‚Äôautres critiques, les buffets sont g√©niaux et le personnel vraiment sympathique.A mon avis il faudrait que le groupe Hilton arrive √† faire fermer cette boite de nuit tapageuse au risque que les clients fassent un autre choix pour s√©journer √† Windhoek.","Date of stay: May 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Probably the""WORST HILTON IN THE WORLD""","This is the second time I post a comment about this hotel.After a bad experience two year ago I decided to give them a second chance because the room is nice and the swiming pool is great and two year ago this place had just open and that can explain the bad service at that time.So two year later it is worst than ever!!!1- less than half of the staff where on duty because of a stryke for more than a week...2- this is probably the only one five stars hotel in the world where you don't have a botle of water in      your room ( and the minibar)! I had to go at the gas station 500m. away at 10pm to get one!!!3- 2 of the 3 bars and restaurants where simply close!!!4- the only one open restaurant was running without a chef ! and on the menu you have the choice     of 5 main courses only!5- I was expecting a massage at the Spa, It was close!6- they pretend to be short of staff but for a private fonction at the Skybar they have enough staf     and the next day this bar was close...Conclusion, regarding the staff problem they should close the hotel at that time or the minimumthey can do is sending a mail before to their clients to give them the choice to cancel their booking!It look's like the politic of Hilton is to get the money of their customers at any price include the worst service ever... Shame on you Hilton!P.S. The general manager was simply gone...","Date of stay: December 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Liked it, didn't love it","Spent two nights at this hotel after 1 night at the Durban Hilton. The room was excellent, with an open plan bathroom design that I've never seen before. This made the room seem huge and certainly less claustrophobic than many hotel rooms I've stayed in. Strange that a complimentary bottle of water is not placed in the room in the Windhoek Hilton, but was in the Durban one. I ordered a room service dinner on my first night as I'd gotten to the hotel in the early evening after a long trip and wanted an early night. A number of items on the menu were not available, especially the types of bottled mineral water they claimed to offer. When my meal arrived, the waitress had 'forgotten' the salad I had ordered(which was on the bill), bringing only the main course. She ran off to fetch the salad, saying it was ready and she would 'bring it in 5 minutes'. It arrived 15 minutes later. On my last morning there, I was scheduled to check out before breakfast (they start serving at 7 a.m., which in my opinion is a bit late if you have an early start to your day planned), but they confirmed they would pack me a breakfast box which I would collect from the reception the following morning. When I arrived at the reception to check out, there was no breakfast box in sight so they sent a waiter from the restaurant to hastily pack one. The contents were a croissant, a Danish, a banana and a yoghurt. This for the full breakfast charge on my room bill!Despite the issues I've mentioned, my overall experience of the hotel was positive and I would definitely stay there again.","Date of stay: September 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Classico...nel bene e nel male","Andare all'Hilton significa sapere cosa si desidera e si ha la certezza di trovarlo sempre. Caso tipico questo Hilton della capitale della Namibia, posto in posizione invidiabile al centro della citt√†, lungo la via commerciale per eccellenza. Struttura moderna, molto acciaio e cristallo soprattutto all'interno, inserita perfettamente nel contesto cittadino. Camere razionali, ben arredate e con tutti i conforta, sia a livello di dotazioni per il bagno, sia per quello che riguarda tv e connessioni internet. Gradevoli il ristorante e il bar all'ultimo piano e quello CGE si apre sulla balconata al piano terra. Servizio desk e ristorante professionale quanto basta. Neo piuttosto grosso, ma probabilmente un caso, l'ora abbondante per avere le camere, ancora non pronte alle 6 del pomeriggio....insomma, tutto troppo normale, visto e rivisto, come dicevo all'inizio. Nella media, nel bene e nel male.","Date of stay: August 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Naja...","Wir hatten uns f√ºr das Hilton entschieden, da es uns als das beste Hotel im Ort erschien. Vergleiche kann ich keine ziehen, au√üer zu Hilton-Hotels in anderen Teilen der Welt. Insgesamt hat es die Erwartungen erf√ºllt, allerdings fiel hier auf, dass der Service sehr sehr schleppend war. Der Poolboy ben√∂tigte morgens ewig, um die Liegest√ºhle herzurrichten, will man mal einen Sonderwunsch wie einen Schirm oder das Verstellen einer Liege, muss man sich auch auf l√§ngere Wartezeiten einrichten. Wir hatten einmal dort zu Mittag gegessen (a la carte) und mussten 1,5 Stunden auf das Essen warten. Als wir abends zum Buffet wollten, sagte man uns, wir sollten sp√§ter wiederkommen, alle Tische seien belegt. Als wir dann sp√§ter wiederkamen, war das Buffet schon fast abgegrast. Wir bekamen zwar noch frisch gebratene Steaks, diese waren allerdings kaum genie√übar, da z√§h. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war gut und reichhaltig, die Dame an der Eierstation war aber auch nicht von der allerschnellsten Sorte und so waren die Eier meist nicht weich- sondern hartgekocht, auch weil sie zwischendurch √∂fter intensiv mit ihrem Handy besch√§ftigt war. Am Tag nach Silvester fehlte der Schl√ºssel zur Poolbar, weshalb es keine Getr√§nke gab und an unserem letzten Tag fehlte morgens der Schl√ºssel zum Fr√ºhst√ºcksraum, so dass wir eine halbe Stunde warten mussten (und wir hatten es eilig, da wir zum Flughafen mussten...)Obwohl wir ein Nichtraucherzimmer wollten, bekamen wir ein Raucherzimmer (wohl weil das gew√ºnschte noch nicht fertig war). Hier lag auch schonmal die ein oder andere Zigarettenkippe auf dem Flur.WLan ist sehr teuer, ich meine, es sind um die 100 Euro pro Woche. Das Sportstudio ist klein aber das Wichtigste ist vorhanden. Die Dachterrasse mit Pool ist ganz h√ºbsch und insgesamt kann man hier mal ein, zwei N√§chte verbringen. Zur Not gibts ja in Laufn√§he noch einen KFC und eine Tankstelle :-)","Date of stay: December 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sch√∂ner Auftakt einer tollen Reise","Das Hotel ist schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen und w√ºrde an vielen Ecken etwas Ausbesserung vertragen. Trotzdem war es ein sch√∂ner und herzlicher Aufenthalt. Die Zimmer sind gro√üz√ºgig und weitestgehend sauber. F√ºr meinen Anspruch super aber ob das der Anspruch eines 5-Sterne-Hotels ist..klebrige R√§nder unter den Gl√§sern bzw. Abdr√ºcke von Gl√§sern auf dem Nachtisch - das sollte nicht sein. Das Personal ist ausgesprochen freundlich und w√ºrde von mir eine 5-Sterne Bewertung bekommen! Wirklich toll und auch f√ºr Kinderw√ºnsche wird alles m√∂glich gemacht. Das Highlight ist definitiv der Rooftop Pool mit Bar.

"What a visit","We thought the Hilton was just wonderful!  They have a great program whereby one lucky guest can become the guest of the day and get complimentary high tea in their room, free sunset drink at the sky bar, light dinner at the executive lounge and free breakfast.  When the wonderful young lady who checked in my wife and I realized we were the guests of the day, she literally did a ‚Äúhappy dance‚Äù in front of us for about 30 seconds.  We were stunned and appreciate of this very personal display of happiness for us. And had she realized it was our 25th wedding anniversary, she would have shared our huge admiration for her welcome.   After that, every other staff member at the Windhoek Hilton went above and beyond to make us feel welcome from the rooms cleaners, the bar staff at the sky bar, to Giovanni at the executive lounge and the concierge who gave us great advice where to explore Windhoek.  Honestly we felt special, very special and we cannot thank the Hilton Windhoek and it‚Äôs special staff enough for the best hotel stay We have ever had in our lives.","Date of stay: August 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"COMMUNICATION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS IMPROVING","Not to bore everyone with the nitty gritty details of my experience I will cut it down to say:The rooms are very comfortable but you can hear noise from the street.  There was some really loud music being played in a shop across the road which was really annoying.  Building work going on and noise from hammering concrete was heard throughout the daytime in the room.Very rude girl in lobby bar.  I was gobsmacked by the lack of interest in a customer and the look of being pissed off on her face was there for everyone to see.  Everyone has a bad day but she was like it the whole time I was there.  The only time she smiled was when a fellow collegue came to talk to her.The food in the restaurant was fantastic and very jolly people serving the food behind the counter.  The service at breakfast was slow but the girls were pleasant.If someone from the hotel would like to hear the detailed versi√≥n then let me know.","Date of stay: October 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A large building site but still very comfortable ","There‚Äôs a lot going on as the Hilton is expanded and becoming a Hilton garden hotel. The rooms are large and comfortable. Like some city centre business hotels there was a feeling that rooms were set up for the single business visitor. One bottle of water, one set of toiletries at first but improved on day 2. Why can‚Äôt hotels prepare the rooms for those whom they know are coming. The restaurant menu is limited if you don‚Äôt want the buffet. The night of the Indian buffet left us a disadvantage! Breakfasts are excellent although the over zealous breakfast supervisors in sashes were a little OTT. No doubt the new expanded Hilton will have increased facilities and lifts that are always working! We were marooned on the 6th floor and were rescued by a housekeeper who took us down in the service lift!","Date of stay: September 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Beware that the parking charges are astronomical and a bit of a rip-off, whilst the internet speed is incredibly slow and cuts out at times.

"Flawless","We had a two night stay at the beginning of our vacation in Namibia and an additional night at the end of the trip. Both stays were pleasant.After 24 hours of flying we arrived late in the evening and we're quickly checked in. We had pre-ordered a sandwich and cheese plate and they were delivered to the room a few minutes after we arrived. There was more than enough for two people. All staff members were professional and helpful. The room was clean spacious. The bathroom has an open design with a lot of glass and the only absolute privacy is in the shower and toilet area. This is something to seriously consider if you or your travel partner require/desire privacy.The breakfast buffet selection is incredible and was delicious. The checkout process was fast and the bill was accurate.","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Id√©alement situ√©, moderne et √©l√©gant","Le Hilton Windhoek se trouve en plein coeur de la capitale namibienne.

"Mixed Thoughts","As a Lifetime Hilton Diamond member, we were at the Hilton Windhoek twice before and after our tour across Namibia with Ultimate Safaris.  Our experiences between the first and second stay was noticeably different.  The first stay we were in Room 302 and it was not a very good room.  It was a handicapped room and the bathroom corners were dirty.  For the second stay, we were in room 811 and it was noticeably nicer.In room 811, I had a complimentary bottle of wine and in room slippers that I did not have on the first stay.  I'm not sure whether it was because I used points for the first stay and cash and points for the second but the rooms were noticeably different.There is an Executive Lounge on the top floor that serves hot and cold food.  For the first stay, the gentleman there provided great service.  For the second, a lady was there and she wasn't as attentive.  Seating is limited and since all the tables on the first floor were occupied, we had to sit on the 2nd level.  However, for the second stay, the Lounge was quite empty.  You can also help yourself to alcohol at the Lounge.We took a taxi from the airport.  The rate is fixed at 350 NAD.  For the return, Hilton arranged for Hertz to take us to the airport for 341 NAD and you can charge the fare to your room.  It takes about 30-40 minutes to get to/from the airport.In Windhoek, this is considered a luxury hotel but the rooms could use some updating.  Overall, our stay was mediocre.","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Excellent bread and pastries and a wide selection of fresh fruit. They had the typical eggs, meat and other breakfast items.  Lunch time salads in the same restaurant were very tasty.

"Great breakfast, OK Wifi and a leaking rooftop pool","Stayed here for one night on a business trip. Had a great sleep given that I was completely jetlagged. Wifi was indeed not the best but manageable. Highlight of the trip, however, was the breakfast which is truly excellent. Overall good hotel - but with one potentially fatal flaw...Despite this being a very good hotel, I strongly urge the management of this place to look straight up and note the gigantic wet stain that can be seen directly below the rooftop swimming pool. Clearly the pool is leaking and I frankly fear for the structural integrity of the roof over time if nothing is done. Hopefully, the hotel staff aren't planning for a remake of the swimming pool scene in ""The Mechanic: Resurrection""...However, as the roof held during my stay, I had a very good stay","Date of stay: April 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sch√∂nes Haus,  schlechter Service.","Wir verbrachten die erste und die letzte Nacht unserer Namibia-Rundreise im Hilton Windhoek. Das Haus liegt sehr gut und ist modern gestaltet. Der Check-In verlief beide Male professionell, aber eher unpers√∂nlich und distanziert. Echte Freundlichkeit schaut anders aus - und genau das zieht sich dann wie ein roter Faden quer durch das ganze Haus. Das √ºberrascht umso mehr, als wir Namibia als ein sehr freundliches und herzliches Land kennengelernt haben. Grunds√§tzlich funktioniert alles gut und professionell, allerdings hinterlassen die Mitarbeiter keinen wirklich motivierten und kundenorientierten Eindruck.Die Zimmer waren angenehm gro√ü, sch√∂n eingerichtet und sauber. Nichts au√üergew√∂hnliches, aber guter Hilton-Standard halt. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war unterdurchschnittlich, sowohl vom Service als auch von der Qualit√§t her. Der Service hinterlie√ü einen √ºberforderten Eindruck.Eine echte Entt√§uschung war die Sky-Bar: die bestellten Burger bzw. Sandwiches waren kalt und die French Fries komplett versalzen. Auf unsere Reklamation hin brachte man uns nach 30 Minuten frische Pommes, diesmal nicht gesalzen daf√ºr aber laff. Dass wir die reklamierten Pommes dann doppelt auf der Rechnung wiederfanden rundete das Bild ab.Wir haben schon viele Hiltons gesehen, aber dieses ist vom Kundenservice und der gebotenen Qualit√§t mit Abstand das schlechteste. By the way: es war auch der schlechteste Service auf der ganzen Rundreise. Echt schade! Die 3 Bewertungspunkte sind sehr wohlwollend und der guten Infrastrukur des Hauses geschuldet.","Date of stay: February 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The rooftop pool is quite nice although the weather did not cooperate with us. The bar as well has a nice view of the city. We had breakfast included in our stay and the restaurant was very nice. The buffet had numerous hot and cold options which were all very delicious. Would definitely recommend staying here in Windhoek if here for business or pleasure. It was a very nice way to end our Namibian self-drive road trip with some pampering.","Date of stay: February 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not up to par for an international top brand","We stayed at the Hilton twice, once arriving in Namibia and the night prior to departure. To say the least, we would have expected more from a hotel of this reputation and size.The rooms are spacious and nicely designed but not well maintained.Doors need to be slammed shut for the locks to close.The staff was very friendly, the concierge took care of dinner bookings and transportation which was super helpful, yet compared with other hotels we visited in Namibia - and rated recently- we wouldn't do any other place justice if we gave the Hilton more than three stars.

"Hilton at its best","I chose Hilton as starting point of my Namibia trip and it was the right choice after the 20 hrs flight from Europe.Room - I had an executive suite in the 7th floor, spacious, clean, nice view, all necessary amenities available. Strong wifi, comfy bed, the bad was with shower and tun, strong hot water.Reception, check-in: top-notch and very helpful - exactly what you would expect in this category. I arrived at 6 pm and was urgently looking for a grocery shop - the receptionist inquired promptly if there is one still open, where and how to get there.Restaurant - good variety of meals, for dinner it is either a la carte or buffet. Parking - if you are first time driving a 4x4 it is a bit difficult to navigate inside as the parking is built for standard 2x4. How to get there - when I was there, the Rev Michael Scott St was under construction so we had to drive through the Himba market on the Independence Avenue to get into the parking deck.Location - CBD, close to many shops, grocery shops, the Christ church, gas station on the Independence Avenue when driving towards Rehoboth.

"Preferred hotel in Windhoek","This hotel lives up to the international Hilton standard. It is more expensive than other accommodation in the city but the quality of accommodation and service as well as the location of the hotel is worth it.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt","Das Hotel liegt ziemlich zentral. Die Zimmer sind sehr sch√∂n, in sehr gutem Zustand und sehr sauber. Das Fr√ºhst√ºcks Buffet ist reichhaltig und von guter Qualit√§t. Das Personal an der Rezeption ist sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Bis auf wenige Ausnahmen ist das Personal generell sehr nett.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Top Hotel ","Das Hotel ist wirklich top. Sehr sch√∂ne Zimmer, super Lage, toller Rooftop Pool und gute Preise f√ºr Getr√§nke an der Sky Bar. Einzig einen Punkt Abzug, da man an der ein oder anderen Stelle sieht, dass nicht immer zu 100 % M√§ngel behoben werden (z.B.fleckige Teppichb√∂den). Dies w√§re in anderen Hilton Hotels in anderen L√§ndern definitiv nicht so. Insgesamt w√ºrden wir aber das Hotel wieder buchen.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ok, but not more...","If you go to Namibia then try get out of Windhoek ASAP! Windhoek is quite an ugly city and there is really nothing to do! It is difficult to even stay at a good hotel. As we had to spend 3 days in Windhoek, we decided to spend 2 nights at Hilton (cause we thought that might be one of the only places that are acceptable). Even that it was ok there (clean, food was ok, service was good) don't expect it to be on a European or similar standard... Quite funny clientele (we had the feeling local people were hanging around by the pool, even staff and some funny arrangements)! Unfortunately it is totally overpriced for that quality, means the sky bar, restaurants, wifi and even a simple bottle of water. I'm sure the room cleaner took 20‚Ç¨ out my purse when we've been at breakfast. She left the 50‚Ç¨ in it, maybe so that I don't notice (so please make sure you use the safe there!!!). All in all the stay was acceptable, but we've been to other places in South Africa or other countries for less money and a way better experience. The atmosphere at Hilton Windhoek is cold and more of a business hotel (where you PAY for the wifi!). I don't think I would go back there, but to be honest I wouldn't even come back to Windhoek.... On the other hand, if you have to spend a night in Windhoek then the Hilton might still be one of the only options.","Date of stay: August 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great city stopover","Stayed here twice - One night at the start and one night at the end of a two week trip across Namibia. Both times check-in was fast and pleasant - very friendly staff who remembered us when we returned. Rooms are very clean, Wifi was good (for Namibia) and enjoyed our stay.The breakfasts are excellent and all that you would expect. We dined both times in the restaurant, which was very good - buffet style but great choices and very good staff service.Will happily return","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"lovely hotel","The roof top bar is great and there are out door heaters too as it was a bit chilly at night. The bedroom was lovely apart from the open plan bathroom which was awkward for a grown up family.The breakfast buffet is excellent. When we arrived late at night we were offered parking outside by an odd man and told to buy a ticket from a shop. However at reception we were told this was unsafe and should park in the hotels  underground car park which we did.","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great African hospitality","I arrived the Hilton Windhoek around 11 pm after a long flight feeling tired and in a sullen mood.However as soon as I alighted from the bus, I was met with a  cheery welcome from the doorman and this started to lighten my mood.Claudia who attended to me at the reception desk brightened it further by her quick and efficient check in and her friendly countenance.I was impressed with this hotel. A gleaming modern structure with contemporary decor and kept sparkling clean.The rooms were well appointed and roomy.What I didn't quite like was the bed. It was too springy.That,and the bath that was open to all without privacy.The restaurant served varieties of dishes local and international and  they were quite a delight to taste.The staff attended to you promptly and courteously.Indeed what stuck me most about the hotel was  the attitude of staff.They were friendly and welcoming and in the true African tradition ,not only greeted you but asked  after your health and wether you were enjoying your stay.In some other places I had visited you were only entitled to a curt ' good morning ' or a nod.However, it was Gabriel the concierge who embodied the true African spirit.I had forgotten my phone in the taxi that had dropped me one evening. When I related the incidence to him,he went out of his way to trace and locate the taxi and had the driver bring back my phone to the hotel in no short time.If ever life's journey brings me back to these parts again,I will head straight to the warm embrace and hospitality of Hilton Windhoek.","Date of stay: June 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Courtesy, courtesy, courtesy and more courtesy!","Great location. Very clean and comfortable room. Staff very courteous; 'Make it Right' policy being applied. Had an early start one morning, requested breakfast in bed between 06h00 and 06h30, and it was brought to room on time. Enjoyed some sundowners while reading a book on rooftop. Was later joined by some new friends who were staying somewhere else. Will definitely be going back.Not advised that cab fare charged per trip or per person. Shared a cab with some new friends and were all shocked when driver requested ridiculous amount! Negotiate before jumping in!

"REALLY BEAUTIFUL","You will enjoy the decoration. Those white lights , I HOPE IT WAS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE FESTIVE SEASON.I enjoyed the lift. In most of the hotel , the lift is usually sad. someone feel alone. But because the hotel lift is transparent and out of the wall.The design of the rooms are very original with communication between the bath rooms and the room. The hotel can equally organize pick up by taxis and charge to your room. The hotel can make  a take away for your breakfast if you wish to leave earlier. Being a HHONOURS member gives you advantages. The reason why I did not rate the hotel excellent is because of the weakness in terms of business centers. You can not easily do scanners, and printing if you would like to do some kind of personal administration. When you are many, pay equally attention not to get your luggage mixed as it could take time to get it  in your room.","Date of stay: December 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Deceptive advertising","Hilton proudly advertises live jazz entertainment on Thursdays. Hence, we enthusiastically arranged our schedule to fit this in. We tried several times to call for confirmation--always busy signal. Got a taxi that took us there, but no jazz. The barman in Kalabar did not know when or if jazz might resume, but there sure was none that evening. I checked with Guest Relations, where the staff member had no clue. I do understand that sometimes plans change, but what annoyed me was that  neither of these gentlemen saw any problem whatsoever with advertising an activity that does not take place.","Date of stay: January 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There is a skybar with beautiful expansive views over Windhoek with a gym and a few eateries on the premises.

"Lovely hotel but fraught with shortcomings","This is one of those hotels that looks really nice and is a stand out in Windhoek CBD.  But up close you can see all of the problems--the staff does not seem to know what to do half the time, the internet was so slow I could not even do research on the web, towels and sheets late (they seem to have a perennial shortage of these and have to wash them first), and one of the most ignorant concierge teams ever encountered.  On the pro side: very nice rooms, excellent location, and dinner buffet at their restaurant was a great bang for my buck. I stayed a total of four nights last week and would think very carefully about coming back here to stay.","Date of stay: August 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"luxe voor de safari","Geboekt met airmiles aan het begin en het einde van onze safari. De eerste nacht hadden we een executive room. Enigszins gedateerde inrichting. prachtig uitzicht vanaf de 8ste etage. Gebruikt van wat extra faciliteiten in het hotel waren inbegrepen. Echter het eten wat werd geserveerd heeft waarschijnlijk een hele dag gestaan. De kazen waren behoorlijk uitgedroogd. Tweede nacht als afsluiting van de safari hadden we een deluxe kamer. Qua inrichting veel beter, retro thema. Ontbijt zeer uitgebreid echter jammer dat dit pas vanaf 7:00 kan.Skybar 9e etage, erg aangenaam bij warm weer, ook als je niet verblijft in het Hotel met spectaculaire zonsondergang.","Date of stay: July 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Luxurious but very noisy","My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Windhoek for two nights at the end of a safari trip to Namibia. The hotel is very new and clean. The rooms and bathrooms are huge and beautiful, with a very modern and trendy design. The breakfast is not free but is worth the price, being much more extensive than your typical continental breakfast and including fresh, custom-made juices. The rooftop pool is heated and you get a great view of Windhoek. There are some issues, however. Although Wi-Fi is free in the lobby, you have to pay approximately $15 US for Wi-Fi in your room per day. Despite charging this amount, the Wi-Fi is painfully slow. You may be able to check e-mail, but you will not be able to use Skype for example. Also, DO NOT accept a room on the first floor as we did. There is a bar/nightclub on the mezzanine level directly below and you will hear music in your room well into the night, disrupting your sleep. On our last night, we had to wake up very early in the morning to catch a flight and as a result we had almost no sleep due to the noise.","Date of stay: June 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A Good Choice","I stayed at this hotel my final night in Namibia after nine days out in the Bush.  I had stayed in a guesthouse (bed and breakfast) the prior time and I wanted to try a hotel instead. I was generally pleased with the Hilton.  It is fairly new and looks it.  It is large, so it has a lot of facilities.  My room was very large.  The bathroom was large and very functional.  The staff was friendly.  The location is good as far as things to do in Windhoek but is distant from the airport.  I would consider staying here again.  I liked it better than a guesthouse.  The only negatives were that the hotel charges for internet in one's room, which really annoys me.  In this day and age, internet should be free to guests.  Also, I asked for a wake up call and the call never came.  Fortunately, I woke up anyway.  If I would have slept in and missed my flight, I would have been very upset.","Date of stay: April 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Zentrale Lage in Windhoek","Das Hilton liegt zentral an der Haupteinkaufsstrasse von Windhoek. Man kann von hier aus alles zu Fu√ü unternehmen. Allerdings wird derzeit um das Hotel gebaut, aber im Hotel selbst merkt man nichts davon. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Zimmer modern, etwas unpers√∂nlich, eingerichtet. Ein typisches Business-Hotel. Auf dem Dach befindet sich eine sehr sch√∂ne Roof Top Bar mit herrlichem Blick √ºber Windhoek (bietet sich f√ºr Sundowner an). Hier befindet sich auch der Swimmingpool mit Liegen, Sonnenschirmen und Lounge M√∂beln.Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist reichhaltig und gut.

"What a massive turnaround. Fantastic Service","My first 2 visits to the Hilton were an absolute nightmare. This is however no longer the case. With my last few visits, the service improved significantly and the efficiency and friendliness of the Staff was phenomenal. I commend the Hilton Hotel Windhoek for the changes they have made. I would also like to mention one of their Reception Staff, Aubrey. This young man is very efficient and a true ambassador of the Hilton brand name. Thank You for the massive service improvement and you will definitely see me there. For any visiting guests, try their Sushi bar... The sushi there is one of my top 2 I have ever tasted. Wesley is a fantastic Sushi Chef.

"Hilton Windhoek - the place to stay","The Hilton Windhoek is the place to stay when you are visiting Windhoek. You will be greated by very friendly staff, who are happy to assist when asked. The rooms are very luxurious and offers great views of the city! The rooftop bar is an excellent place to unwind, catch some sun and have an afternoon drink. Just incase you need pampering, the spa facility provides that too!  For the travellers who still need a workout, there is a state of the art gym, that will help you keep in shape, and lap pool too.","Date of stay: November 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ultra Modern","What a surprise to find this ultra modern hotel in the middle of Namibia!  The rooms are all understated elegance and the public spaces invite lingering.  We only had breakfast here; the food and selection was great, but the staff seemed a little distracted and not too attentive.

"Classy Hotel in Windhoek","The Windhoek Hilton is a shining beacon in Windhoeks hotel wasteland, standing head and shoulders above its peers.The rooms are superb, with comfortable beds ideal for the weary business traveller in search of a good night‚Äôs rest.  The room are exactly what you would expect from any top international hotel: spacious, clean and modern. The other hotel facilities are equally worth mentioning. The pool deck on the 9th floor (and overlooks the whole of Windhoek) is a must see ‚Äì even if you aren‚Äôt staying at the hotel. The hotel staff have a single mission ‚Äì to serve. And they do it well. The reception team phoned a number of restaurants and bars at 11pm on our behalf in an attempt to help us enjoy a good night out (Windhoek, being the city it is, was less obliging). The few negatives of our stay included the hotel bar not being open at 11pm, the 24 hour wifi pass which actually means ‚Äúaccess until 7am‚Äù and the fitness centre which half heartedly catered for weight‚Äôs enthusiasts.","Date of stay: September 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great for a one night stay","I stayed here with my 2 kids on our way up to Etosha. The hotel is well placed on the road from the airport but was a bit tricky to get into as there were roadworks and we had to drive around to get to the entrance. The room was very well appointed, the bedding was of an excellent quality and the bathroom beautiful, large bath and large shower. The items in the bar fridge were expensive and wifi was as at an exorbitant charge, far lesser and cheaper hotels offer wifi for free so this was a surprise. I did not get breakfast included as apparently if you book online this option is then not included I was told on arrival, a pity as the breakfast then became a very expensive buffet option so we did not eat there on leaving. Visit the top floor as the view is well worth the visit and the pool was heated, had we know we would have had a swim on arrival.","Date of stay: August 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton Hotel Windhoek","Generally speaking hotel B&B accommodation in Windhoek is expensive and not to an exceptional quality.

"Surprisingly Good","Before landing in Windhoek I have been reading set of comments from different sites about Hilton Hotel. There were not always positive. Since I intended to stay only two nights I decided that location is the most important factor.To my surprise it was excellent choice. Yes, location was perfect but not only. Rooms are newly refurbished, clean and pleasant, breakfast very good and staff very helpful and competent. Representative of travel agency has organized all our requests for sightseeing and travel around in no time, professionally and efficiently. Thanks to that we have got very good impression about our staying there.","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Even the trainees were excellent and the concierge even helped setup a game drive for our day off (Oka Puka lodge).Rooms was spacious (rain shower is amazing).  And room service and cleaning was excellent.If there was anything to complain about, it might be that hotel restaurant service was a little inattentive, but judging from other Windhoek restaurants, it's the norm.Definitely the Sky bar on 9th floor was one of the top attractions with incredible views of Windhoek.Highly recommended for business.","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Single night in Hilton","Spent a single night here on my arrival into the country. Even as just a Gold HHonors member I was given club access and treated well. The hotel is smaller than most Hiltons, but appropriate for the location I am sure. It is centrally located and easy to access from the airport. The car rental agency in the lobby is very useful if you get there and realize later that driving is easy. The service was very good as well, with everyone friendly and kind to all the visitors. The pool is small and more of a single lap pool about 25 meters long. The food offerings in the lounge on the top floor were very good and from the restaurant, although there were not many choices it was more than sufficient. I had plenty of hot water and no broken items. Very comfortable room with a nice view. Quite a few TV options and decent speed internet to wind down from a long day of flying. Internet is free for status level, but as is typical for all high end Hilton hotels, it is not free for everyone. The one thing I would improve though is it would be nice to have free wifi in the lobby, as the airport has few flights and it would be nice to wait in the lobby rather than at the airport after checkout. I would not hesitate to return here again if I am back in Namibia.","Date of stay: February 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"new hotel in town","it was the last night we stayed here before we flew home from our namibia trip. Very nice hotel and new hotel, very modern. Excellent location in the city centre of Windhoek - close to restaurants, mall, bars and main tourist attraction. it is safe to walk everywhere. the skybar and pool on the 9th floor are great and it is wonderful to relax up there. the service at the sky bar needs improving though - unfriendly and slow. there is also a very good fitness centre and a small spa. The restaurant and bar on the mezzanine are great - food is very good and service friendly and prompt. especially the terrace on the sports bar is great to lounge and relax. the breakfast was outstanding and what you expect from a Hilton Hotel. there is a underground car park, too. you need to pay for WIFI which we found odd, but it was in most hotels or lodges in namibia.","Date of stay: December 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A really nice place to stay","A business trip to Namibia saw us at the Hilton Windhoek and we were pleasantly surprised at how good this property was.  Rooms were very good and spacious with comfortable bed.  Kind of strange bathroom arrangement with lots of glass used.  Too much to be frank.  Not a fan of the current fad (please let it not be a trend) of open plan bedroom/bathroom combinations.  Call me old fashion but I prefer a little privacy when showering..... That aside though the room was nice.  The roof top bath was fabulous, although a little breezy, but a top place for an afternoon drink and it comes free with a view of the fabulous African sunset.Ate twice in the restaurant and on both occasions the food and service were first class.","Date of stay: August 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton Windhoek","Well located hotel, with excellent staff overall. I was disappointed though at check-in that the person who checked us in did not acknowledge our membership of the Honours program and did not inform us of the benefits due to us because of the room we booked. This, however, pales into insignificance when the overall service of the staff at the hotel is considered. Had an excellent stay and could definately iuse this hotel again.","Date of stay: August 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"great rooms - solicitous staff - wonderful sky bar","We bookended our travels in Namibia with stays at the Windhoek Hilton - centrally located in the city.  Both times, we really enjoyed the comfortable, generous rooms (great beds and amenities) and were well taken care of by the solicitous and friendly staff.A visit to the Sky Bar, overlooking the lights of the city, is a fine way to end the day.  The cocktails are excellent and one feels on top of the world.  We also enjoyed the Executive Lounge with its fine coffee and pastries.  When in Windhoek, the Hilton will be our place to stay.","Date of stay: August 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Rooms are not sound proof The design of building emphasise late night nouces from coffee shop on ground floor Better to choose room to the west of buildinf those close to entrance is very noicy.

"Not the Hilton service expected very poor impression!!!","First, to give credit where it is due, the hotel is reasonably clean and located central in Windhoek, the hotel rooms are ok (though some of our bathroom fixtures were broken) and the overall hotel atmosphere is fine.  As the hotel is now two years old I thought the staff would be better trained. What was unacceptable was we made a booking directly with the hotel on the same day as arriving which was on a public holiday. The lady who answered the phone said they can not take any bookings , I asked if they were full and she said no they can't take any bookings even for tonight as the bookings staff were away for the public holiday . I asked if I could book with the front desk and she reluctantly put me through. I made a booking with the front desk agent, a gentleman who gave me an agreed rate .Upon arriving the Duty manager said I could not get my rate as booked because it had to go through her even though the gentleman taking my booking said he checked with Management for my best rate. So she, the duty manager up my agreed rate by 15% which we accepted after a long drive. (We felt cheated.)After checking in we ventured to the full rooftop cocktail bar on the roof and found it took 20 mins to order a drink then another 10 mins to receive it. We saw the lady taking the pool side orders was also helping make the drinks with the barman. They are certainly understaffed in this area to provide service one would expect from this hotel. I don't mind paying for drinks at high prices though the prices charged were outrageous for poor service.The same day, the room service order was very late and we got a call to say that they were delayed . When the food arrived we could not eat half of the dishes , no care or passion was delivered in the preparation and it seemed that the menu's recipes weren't followed. The poorly cooked and flavourless food was sent back and management refunded our bill on the unconsumed orders - no questions asked.   The breakfast buffet was pleasant though trying to get one of our waitresses attention was very difficult as she was wearing headphones and listening to music and and couldn't hear us for attention. Overall I think the hotel has a long way to come in service and quality . There are excellent boutique hotels and short stay pensions in Windhoek and Namibia that would make a much better choice currently.","Date of stay: May 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"From Great to no-good in no time","After frequenting and testing most of the ""worthwhile"" hotels in Windhoek, my wife and I called this our ""home-away-from-home"" in Namibia.  We have stayed at this hotel every time we visited Windhoek over the last two years+. Apart from the average service in the restaurant, everything else was superb.  Our last visit in April 2013, was a nightmare. everything from mini bar to general amenities and the parking pay system were wrong.  Gown and slippers provided for only one person where they knew we were a couple. We showered with cold water for the first day. The bed turndown was done on some nights, on others not.  We were some days required to call for room cleaning.   Arriving at breakfast one hour before closing leaves you with very little choice on the buffet.  I am normally the critiquing party, but this time my wife was soooo upset with the poor performance that she insisted we don't go back there again.  After numerous complaints management tried to make up with a cheese and wine platter, which almost helped us to forgive them. The very last straw was when a service staff member bursted into our room at 06:00 whilst we were still soundly asleep. This is so sad because finding good service in Windhoek in general is an issue.  I hate to think that I have to go back to Namibia and start scouting for a new hotel again!!!!","Date of stay: April 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

What does let it down is the attitude of some staff. My luggage went missing en route from the UK and I asked for some toiletries, mainly a razor and foam. After repeated promises over a period of 5 hours I went out to a supermarket and bought the items I had requested.

"Doesn't quite meet the expectations that the company creates","Overall, the appearance and facilities are good at the hotel.  Our room was large and comfortable and the pool and bar are very pleasant.  However, it is part of the Hilton chain of hotels and is llisted as 5 star; regardless of where it is, the expectation is that it will deliver the same standards.  The restaurant was a massive disappointment - the vegetarian food was truly awful and I don't expect to find a buffet bar for salads etc in a hotel of this class.We were also woken up at 6 in the morning by an incredible noise coming from the plumbing system in a neighbouring room.The staff were all very pleasant but the service was a little haphazard.  For example, there were no towels or ashtrays at the pool on one occasion despite the fact that there were plenty of staff and 'managers' around and when we asked for a towel, the staff member went off to get some and didn't come back.The fact that they charge a lot for wifi access and then restrict the access to a single machine is inexcusable in this day & age.  We stayed at plenty of smaller, locally owned hotels & B&Bs in Namibia where internet access was free.I'm sure that if we had been staying in an independent hotel these little glitches would have been acceptable but a huge chain like Hilton that trades on its name should live up to the expectations it creates.  The problem is that if you want to stay centrally in Windhoek there isn't a huge amount of choice and I suspect that the choice will reduce even more with the Hilton there.  I would ceratinly try to find an independent, locally owned, hotel if I go back to Windhoek - at least the money stays in the country that way.","Date of stay: February 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A great place to wash the sand out of your hair!","We stayed in the Hilton on our last night in Namibia. We had travelled for 14 days and came from the Namib desert-covered in sand and full of wonderful impressions. This was a great hotel to scrub up before a long haul flight back to Europe and to let all the impressions sink in. We spent the afternoon on the rooftop bar, enjoying the view and the wine and one last Namibian sunset. We were too tired to head out for dinner so we enjoyed the luxurious buffet very much. Its a modern hotel but is located right in the heart of Windhoek, luxurious but unpretentious.","Date of stay: November 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"New & modern Hilton; a good option in Windhoek","We spent the first and last nights of our Namibia trip at this hotel and we were very happy with it. We prefer modern to old style so we had chosen Hilton over Hotel Heinitzburg and did not regret our choice.When you spend a week in rather rustic camps with limited comfort, it feels great to be able to spend a couple of nights in ""luxury"". We liked: the design of the room, the comfort of the bed, the very professional service, to be upgraded to a suite with access to the lounge at the top floor; the complimentary bottle of sparkling wine (honeymooners), the buffet breakfast, live piano in the lobby.Exemples of the good service: the morning we left, we had to catch an early flight and breakfast was not available yet; they provided us with a breakfast box to go. Also, we booked our transfer with the hotel on the night before our departure and the clerk had told us it was a certain price. When we checked out, a higher price was charged, and when we told them, they quickly adjusted the invoice according to the price we had been told the night before.We did not use the pool as it was too cold for that, but the view from the pool area is nice. Same in the business lounge next to it.There is not really anything worth mentioning that we did not like, except maybe that the restaurant had ran out of the dish we wanted to order (local fish) one night and the piece of carrot cake we ordered from the bar in the lobby area was old and dry.Besides these small details, I recommend this hotel if you are looking for something comfortable and modern.","Date of stay: August 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Service needs attention","The facilities at the hotel were excellent and the decor inn the foyer was very appropriate to Namibia. The room I stayed in had an extremely comfortable bed and was beautifully decorated. I would return in the hope the the niggles I mention below will have been addrressed,The temerature of the water during my shower fluctauated continuously without my adjusting the tap, varying from uncomfortably hot water to cold water in an instant. What also needs attention is the level of service provided. despite the staff I met being eager to please there were some problems. I alerted the IT department thatt the internet in my room was not working. Very soon after an maintenance person arrived but could not fix the problem, stating that a technical person from T would need to attend to the problem, only to be told then that this could not happen as the IT person was asleep - this at 20:30!. The other incident was when I went down for breakfast at 07:20. I arrived to closed doors, with the explanation that the restaurant manager had not arrived yet to open the doors despite the opening hour being 07:00. A staff member did kindly offer to take my order and bring my breakfast up to my room, which they did within 12 minutes - but unfortunately did not deliver what I had ordered.","Date of stay: June 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lazy Staff ","The Laziest Food and Beverage staff I‚Äôve encountered in all my business travels. They will give the silliest excuses not to serve you. From ‚Äúsorry we are busy with breakfast and cannot attend ur order, at 11:00 am‚Äù to ‚Äúsorry we can make u a sirloin but not a rump steak, we are low on staff‚Äù The FnB manager does not exist, and the ironic part is that they manage to get the job done only after you complain.5 star?

"A welcome travel respite","We were on the road for 2 days and were given a free early checkin and room upgrade to a 2 room corner sweet with 2 bathrooms. Lovely room, soft bed and a welcome fruit plate. The dinner which was great with lots of choices and drinks was included making it a wonderful experience and deal as well. Hilton was good as it‚Äôs name and made me happy to be an honors member. The staff was very helpful and the manager Jacob chatted with us at dinner.  I would happily stay there again, they arranged transit from the airport making it all seem less.","Date of stay: May 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comfortable option downtown","The hotel and room  were comfortable. Room a little worn but overall met expectations. It was spacious and had everything I needed. Hotel located downtown and you can take a shortcut via the casino. It is irritating that beggars are quite pushy downtown (but not dangerous) meaning I had to escape into a shop on a mumber of occasions. Parking uncomplicated under hotel at small charge. The bar had a great viewover Windhoek.","Date of stay: December 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Although I asked to delete it immediately, they didn‚Äôt do so until they confirmed, which forced me to wait for 30mins keeping waiting for a taxi to the airport.  Although this was caused by their negligence of checking of signing information at the time of consumption in the bar, they never apologized to me.","Date of stay: August 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A wonderful and perfect place to Begin  and  to End your journey through beautiful Namibia!","Hilton Windhoek thoroughly met our needs snd expectation at the beginning and the end of our 22 days self-drive road trip tour through out beautiful  Namibia.Somehow when I was looking for a hotel in Windhoek  to springboard our trip through out Namibia it was not easy to find an accommodation  that meets location + comfort... and I was lucky to disregard some of the negative reviews of this hotel and trust my travel experience and intuition by going ahead in booking the Hilton Windhoek ....This hotel is exactly what is expected to find in an international hotel... it's beautiful, elegant , modern public spaces ... its restaurant in the second floor where breakfast is served is spacious and well appointed its restaurant -bar-pool lounge area is perfect for a beautiful sundowner and a quick dinner under the stars overlooking Windhoek cityscape...What comfortable beds were awaiting for us after our long 20 hours long flights from Los Angeles, Ca  and a very delicious buffet breakfast with a great variety of choices was awaiting for us in the next morning ....The staff through out the hotel were all equally very gracious  and ready to help with a wide warm smile ... I definitely highly recommend this hotel for anybody no matter if you're in Windhoek for business  or on a holiday ...or if you're part of a tour group or you're a solo traveler... the hotel will meet your needs and expectations ...","Date of stay: July 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A pleasant stay in Windhoek.  The elevators were an issue...","I stayed at the Hilton Windhoek for two nights while in the city for business.  I'm a Hilton Honors member and tend to chose Hilton hotels where possible.  I had thought my office had booked a car for me from the airport but there wasn't one on arrival.  I phoned the hotel and they said they had no record of that (which was correct as I had been mistaken).  I was disappointed however that they didn't offer assistance or use their initiative to offer advice on transfer options.  The hotel is well presented, modern and clean.  My room was comfortable and had the ability to open a window (which I always prefer to AC). I tripped the electricity in my room while using the iron. The most irksome part of my stay was being stuck in the elevator for 50 minutes on my second evening there.  The elevator wouldn't open and I was stuck inside with a guest from Germany and his son.  We waited patiently to be released.  Upon finally getting free there was no real acknowledgement of the inconvenience at the time.  I mentioned this to the front desk on checking out and the staff member kindly refunded my lunch bill from the previous day.  I would stay at this hotel again. The roof top pool and bar are wonderful.","Date of stay: September 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Every major attraction is within walkable distance.Service was also great, the hotel arrange transfer from the airport and all staff were lovely and helpful.Breakfast had plenty of choice, I especially liked the juice bar.The rooftop terrace with the pool and the bar is the best place to see the sunset.The only weird thing for me was the bathroom being sort of in the middle of the room: it is completely open, so if you get out of the shower or bathtub, you don't have anywhere to hide!","Date of stay: March 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Entt√§uschender Umgang mit den Hotelg√§sten","Wir haben zum Abschluss unseres Namibiaurlaubs und nach einer anstrengenden Rundreise das Hilton gebucht, um uns noch zwei Tage zu erholen. Die Zimmer sind sch√∂n und sauber, auch das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist toll, aber die Poolarea einen ganzen Nachmittag und Abend f√ºr eine Veranstaltung zu sperren, bei der Hotelg√§ste nicht zugelassen sind, ist eine Frechheit! Meine Beschwerde wurde mit einer lapidaren Entschuldigung abgetan, aber nicht die geringste Entsch√§digung. Ich habe den vollen Preis bezahlt, warum bekomme ich nur einen Teil der Leistungen? Warum muss ich meine Freizeit im Zimmer oder in einer Bar verbringen, anstatt am Pool liegend? Das h√§tte ich nicht von einem Hotel in dieser Kategorie erwartet!

"eleganza e ampi spazi con qualche ma...","Abbiamo pernottato in questa struttura appena atterrati a Windhoek, all'inizio del nostro tour della Namibia. CAMERA: molto ampia , silenziosa, pulitissima e confortevole, letto comodo e grandissimo. Il bagno rimane a vista nella camera, scelta stilisticamente originale ma suggerisco la scelta di questa struttura a coppie o amici molto in confidenza...COLAZIONE: il punto forte! Pur avendo girato parecchie strutture credo di non aver mai visto un buffet cos√¨ ricco e curato nel minimo dettaglio, sia nella qualit√† del cibo offerto che nell'esposizione, veramente complimenti!WI FI: piccola nota dolente: era a pagamento (e anche decisamente caro), inoltre abbiamo avuto pi√π di un problema prima di riuscire a connetterci (nonostante mio marito lavori nel campo dell'informatica)SPAZI COMUNI: receptionist molto cortesi, hall molto grande ed elegante. Peccato fosse chiuso il bar all'ultimo piano, ciononostante abbiamo trascorso una piacevole serata nell'altro bar presente nell'hotel, peccato solo ci fossero le prostitute!! In conclusione, consiglio vivamente questo hotel, ma non posso dare il voto massimo per i due piccoli nei gi√† indicati (le prostitute al bar e la connessione wifi assai cara)","Date of stay: August 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Gutes Stadthotel mit schlechtem Service","Das Hilton Windhoek liegt sehr zentral und man kann fussl√§ufig das Zentrum von Windhoek ereeichen. Wir waren w√§hrend unserer Namibia Reise drei Mal dort . Das Hotel ist sicher das beste und komfortabelste, was die Stadt zu bieten hat, Der grosse Schwachpunkt ist jedoch die Rezeption. Das Personal ist √ºberwiegend unfreundlich, beim dritten Check-in hatte man immer noch keine Check-in Daten und bei der Frage, ob ein Fax angekommen ist wird man unfreundlich zum Guest Service abgewiesen, bzw zum Portier. Keiner ist hilfsbereit noch serviceorientiert . Telefonate innerhalb Windhoeks werden abgelehnt, kurzum es gibt trotz der Kategorie null Service.  Die Zimmer sind sehr komfortabel, besonders die Betten, jedoch haben die Zimmer z B  schlechte Verarbeitungsqualit√§t- die Badezimmer weisen z,B in der Dusche schon Besch√§digungen an den Amaturen auf. Ein Pluspunkt ist die Dachterrasse mit der Bar und Pool (insgesamt sehr sch√∂n) und der Sevice im Hauptrestaurant. Die Gastronomie ist sehr gut. Aktuell gibt es zwei Baustellen um das Hotel herum.","Date of stay: May 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great hotel; but I'm not going back because of its wifi policy","I've just stayed at this hotel for the first, and last, time. A two night business trip took me there this week, and on my immediate arrival I was impressed. For about 3 minutes. Whilst a brilliant receptionist was taking me through the amenities of the hotel, I enquired as to the wifi access code. Here's the shocker... There's no free wifi at this hotel.  (How any hotel in this day and age can charge nearly US$20 a day for wifi and not even high speed wifi at that, is beyond me?) So, whilst I loved my room, the food and the all round service; I'm sorry to say I'm not going back until this policy changes. Nor is my client, who was similarly shocked, and has now turned her attention to other Windhoek hotels for her next required set of hotel nights, which number some 12 or so in the next few weeks. A US$20 rip off has cooked the Hilton's goose.  They 'took' us once; but no more!Incidentally TripAdvisor lists free high speed wifi as an amenity on this hotel's listing; something I'm informing them about immediately.  I'm very, very disappointed.","Date of stay: July 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A nice stayover hotel, not much more","This is a very well-located hotel, especially if you are getting to or from the Windhoek airport. The parking downstairs is quite ample and free (at least for the Platinum or Diamond members). Not much around within walking (if you are that kind of a person) or driving distance....The hotel is clean and proper, well-kept and well-run - though I cannot hide the bitterness of being completely mistreated as a Diamond Member of the Hilton chain, but that's just venting :)Rooms are very nice, well-equipped, have at least one European plug, so you don;t have to worry about those weird Namibian/South African adapters. Air conditioners are quiet, efficient, though the elevators ding quite loudly, so make sure to be away from them. Linens and towels are top notch, with the usual Peter Thomas Roth toiletries on offer.The restaurant food was the blandest I ever had, the service was awkward, white wine warm, and the food choices were amazingly unimpressive. Avoid, at all costs.The pool on the top floor is a pathetic little water hole, so do not get your hopes up, but the views from up there are quite nice.The lounge is poorly stacked - no food, just snacks, and I was charged for the white wine, as there were none in the refrigerator -  the lounge clerk told me that of course it will be delivered right away, and it was - with a bill, what a ripoff! In general, the service was surprisingly subpar. Someone has to re-think the whole strategy of addressing the clients' need and reboot the employees' training from point zero.Nice location, bad service. Your choice! :)","Date of stay: November 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Your place if you want new, with a view","This sparkling hotel makes quite a statement in Windhoek's subtle skyline. Hotel still looks brand new with its chic and modern design and decor. No outdated brass doorknobs here; this place makes you want to redesign your bathroom when you get home. Stayed here for a week on business. Rooms were large with a full size desk, bath, and separate shower stall. I requested to not have an adjoining room, but still got one. I was too jet lagged to bother moving, but would HIGHLY recommend that you avoid one as the noise from the next room will likely wake you up several times in the night. Housekeeping was great at the beginning, but toward the end of my stay, started to look too rushed, for example, taking the old bath mat and not leaving a new one. The gym is sufficient, with a nice view. A few cardio machines, a universal, and free weights. The pool is very small, but the deck and view make up for it. Visit the Sky Bar or pool deck at least once during the day and once in the evening for views you won't forget. Restaurant options are decent, service is typically on the slower side, and food is average. (Slightly over priced even by hotel standards, but cheap compared to the outrageously priced shoddy Internet service!) Operational bloopers, such as the room key access for the elevators not working or taking the stairs only to find yourself on another floor with no doorknob on the door to get out, caused me to scratch my head a few times in confusion and realize that not all of their actions are well thought out.Overall, a good stay. The look and feel could rival the swankiest hotels of major cities across the globe, but kinks in service delivery and operations keeps me from giving this hotel a perfect score.","Date of stay: November 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton ist auch in Windhoek fas Hilton","Das Hilton in Windhoek liegt tats√§chlich sehr zentral in der Innenstadt. Alle Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten sind zu Fu√ü sehr gut zu erreichen. Der Service ist leider nicht so, wie wir es von einem Hilton erwarten w√ºrden, aber f√ºr Nambia schon OK.Die Zimmer sind gro√üz√ºgig und sauber. Der Badbereich ist zum Zimmer offen gestaltet, was das Ambiente insgesamt sehr modern wirken l√§sst.In der 9. Etage gibt es einen Pool mit Poolbar, ein kleines Gym und einen Spa-Bereich. Hier oben hat man einen sehr sch√∂nen Blick √ºber die Innenstadt und kann sich ein wenig auf den Urlaub in Namibia einstimmen. Ein Tip: Die Handt√ºcher f√ºr den Poolbereich gibt es im Spa.F√ºr das Abendessen gibt es 3 Restaurants, eines davon bietet ein sensationelles Sushi, das zwar super lecker, aber f√ºr Namibia doch recht teuer ist.Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist tats√§chlich ein absolutes Highlight. Hier gibt es wirklich ALLES was das Herz begehrt. Eine fantastische Auswahl.Sehr positiv ist auch die √ºberwachte Tiefgarage mit direktem Lift in die Lobby.Ein weiterer Tip: Ca. 10 Gehminuten entfernt liegt die Mall ‚ÄûWernhil Park‚Äú die auch am Sonntag ge√∂ffnet ist. Wer also z.B. Noch auf der Suche nach einer Handykarte von MTC ist wird hier f√ºndig.

"great hotel, except for housekeeping","This is a very modern hotel located near the city center. Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. The bath was very modern and provided both a bath tub and shower. The sink was very shallow, so washing any clothes in it would be hard. The exec lounge offered a nice breakfast, which included a few hot options (contrary to what a prior review noted). The lounge manager even ordered an omelet for me one morning! Dinner time in the lounge offered a few hot entrees plus desserts, wine, beer, and spirits, all complimentary. We tried room service for lunch and were pleased. Housekeeping did not do a great job; they failed to honor a couple of simple requests, twice. Otherwise out stay was very pleasant.","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice people but needed process improvement","It's important to note that I arrived here with 18 other people, all experienced travelers heading to the desert. The employees I eventually spoke with were pleasant and helpful; but the process of getting 19 people into 10 rooms didn't go smoothly. It took a long time, and when my roommate and I finally got a room, we opened the door and surprised the heck out the person who was already staying there. We did get a room next try. I also didn't have my luggage as Air Namibia had left it behind. The hotel's amenities kit was only a toothbrush and paste. I don't know what I expected but maybe a little lip balm? Small deodorant? And there wasn't a sundries shop on premises - I'd have begged them to open it. As I noted, there was no problem with any of the employees. I think it was a process issue and might relate only to groups, but that's how a lot of guests come - in a bundle. The room was a standard Hilton room with standard Hilton amenities. The hotel dates from the time when bathrooms featured a lot of glass, so my roommate and I had to consciously respect each other's privacy. At least the WC was closed.","Date of stay: June 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Central location but rooms already musty for a new hotel","I choose to stay at the Hilton most of the time due to its central location. However, the showers are badly designed so that they fill up with water and some of it leaks out when you open the shower door and seeps into the carpet. This gives the rooms a mouldy and musty smell. Some rooms are worse than others but I am yet to get a room   that didn't have this smell. The one room I had was so bad that my sinuses started acting up. I didn't bother to complain as I was there for only one night and was tired and had an early flight the next day. The rooms are otherwise well furnished and stylish. They either need to replace the carpet with tiled or add some sort of barrier strip to the shower cubicles. The service itself is mixed. Room service is great and food is yummy. Concierge and valet service is also wonderful. However, the restaurant staff at breakfast seem to not be bothered about serving their staff. I do not expect to a) need to hunt down someone to order coffee from or b) follow up with them once I have placed my order at a 5 star hotel.","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Small for a hotel like this and wifi has not coverage over there (to improve).Breakfast: good, combination of buffet and on-demand.Staff: friendly and always available.","Date of stay: November 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My stay at the Windhoek HHotel","It is a very nice place for anyone. You can be a couple, family, business, friends or just you trying to get away from everything and everyone. This place will suit you. It is strategically located. Not that you will lack anything while staying there but if you are new in town then you will find it easy to get to important places.  I liked the security of all the things as it is tight and makes one carefree. The staff were super nice too. I will definitely recommend anyone to stay there.","Date of stay: September 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Could have been better","Although the rooms are stylish, the staff is very friendly, the breakfast was exquisite and the hotel in general looked great, the Windhoek Hilton has some issues.We had two separate rooms (one for me and one for my grandparents), both rooms appeared to be very clean, in one room we even found a dead bug in an obvious spot. Also the mini-bars in both rooms weren't stocked (which was annoying after a late arrival and wanting a drink) and simple things like shower caps etc were missing.So although its a nice place, they need to re-educate housekeeping!","Date of stay: January 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great Breakfast","We stayed at the Hilton in Windhoek on our first and last nights in Namibia this year. It is a nice western style hotel in a city that seems to be moving away from a very  colonial style built environment towards a more modern style with mixed results. The rooms are ok and the double beds comfortable.Standard tea and coffee making facilities and flat screen tv.The bathroom area is open.The restaurant was reasonable with a decent selection on the menu. Danny tried the Springbok Carpaccio as a starter which was very tasty and I had  fish for the main course which was ok- It wasn't amazing but it was alright, and  for dinner in western terms not very expensive. The gym on the top floor is small but adequate - the machines are new and it was never busy when we were using it so it was pretty good all in all and has anything you would need, perhaps some heavier free weights would have been useful but thats quibbling! There is a lovely small pool outside the gym next to the rooftop bar area that give a nice rooftop view of the capital. The Breakfast  was exceptional,with a massive  selection and undoubtedly the highlight of our stay at the Hilton. There were some downsides, paying for the wifi is a bit disappointing, especially when we were asked to pay per device when we were told that we wouldn't have to and that it would be just for the room.Having to pay for the parking was also disappointing. The staff at the desk were a mixed bunch also, some were very nice and others not so much.Upon checkout we were asked to pay for  things we had been told were included, which was cleared up eventually to our satisfaction, but as the receptionist himself said somewhat ironically some staff members need to step up their game. This raised a slight chuckle as the person saying it was probably the one we had most qualms with.","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Much better than before","We have been to this hotel at least 3 times before and we had a lot of complaints. Even though nobody contacted us afterwards , it seems as if they did something about the overall service. Sky Bar is an experience. Staff is very friendly. Coffee at breakfast can be quicker and breakfast in-room needs attention - the speed not the food itself - that was good. Would like to see more specials for locals like us.","Date of stay: May 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good enough","I like the title I saw below in a review ""Your place if you want new with a view"" because I thought that this really captured it in someone else's review. It's new, it's nice enough, we got a great price and it's centrally located. I found it a bit awkward and strange and it felt like it just wasn't a very active place. It may be because of the timing of our visit (26th December) but it just didn't feel lively. It was clean but the staff weren't helpful, the way the building is organized wasn't very obvious and we got stuck in a staircase and also stuck in the parking lot another time. I don't have much to say. It was good enough given the price but the place we stayed on our way back through Windhoek was much more charming--if you want something special try a boutique hotel.","Date of stay: December 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A strong showing for a young hotel","The Hilton Windhoek is on its way to being a world-class hotel, but it still in the growing pains phase.  The food and rooms are exceptional.  The location is great for exploring Windhoek.  Service is on-par with other top-rated hotels.  Their attention to detail is where you find some little doubts.  Our small complaints were:1. No wi-fi in the rooms, and we had to pay for common area access in the business center2. The trash room by the elevator smelled really bad, stinking up the hallway near our room3. The inability of the front desk to change more that $200 USD a day into local currency4. As it seems to cater to mostly business travelers, those of us not on an expense account found it annoying that everything was $5 here, $10 there.  A lower base rate, but the little extras add up.Overall, we were pleased with our experience and would not hesitate to stay there again.","Date of stay: December 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice Hotel with a Cigarette Smoke Issue","Hotel is nice and of good quality. Sadly we had an issue with a neighbor smoking in their room as we tried to fall asleep which somehow migrated into our room as if they were smoking right next to us. Staff were not sure how to deal with this and suggested we move to another room. This was not a solution in our opinion as we were only there one night before our long journey home and would have had to  get dressed, packed and then unpack again all when we should have been sleeping!  We felt the offender should have been moved. We were advised that the hotel was non smoking but did not seem to matter.","Date of stay: September 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Some very attractive glass sculpture decorating the entrance hall.The only odd thing was the bedrooms were round an open space looking down into a well that kept reminding us of a prison landing.  I kept looking for the safety nets!","Date of stay: May 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comfortable and well situated hotel","We stayed here at the beginning and end of our Namibia holiday and found the hotel to be very good.It is easy to find from the airport and there is underground parking available. Check in staff were very efficient and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable.Service in the restaurant was variable, with some friendly, helpful staff and some quite offhand staff. The food was fairly good, although the breakfast buffet was a little disappointing. Would definitely stay here again if we were in Windhoek.","Date of stay: November 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice facility, terrible internet","This was my second stay at the Hilton in Windhoek and I will likely stay there again when I return. The facility is nice and it is centrally location. The sunset from the rooftop bar is unequaled. As a business traveler, my main complaint about this Hilton is the internet, which was not working the majority of my five nights there. I was able to buy a data package through the local phone company, but ideally this would not be necessary. I also found the front desk service to be hot and cold. The staff seemed very annoyed at times and completely lovely at others.","Date of stay: September 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Rip Off Credit Card Scammers STAY AWAY!","On check out we were presented with Bar charges that were not ours. After demanding to see the invoices it was clear it wasnt our signature, nor at a time we were even at the hotel. The charges were removed after much discussion. The next day other charges appeared on our credit card. We called several times paying high long distance rates only to eventually be told the charges were for transportation to the river. OVER AN HOUR AFTER WE CHECKED OUT!!!!!!!! Each person said they would look into it. No one ever did nor did they call back. Then other fraudulent charges turned up on the card from unknown sources in Namibia, and we had to cancel the card. Finally, we complained to Hilton Customer Service and they called the hotel and then we were told by them it was a mistake and charges would be reversed. They never were...when we contacted Hilton again they said they were sorry but had no way to get into the billing of that hotel and so couldnt reverse the charge!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMAGINE THIS?! So disappointed in Hilton Main Office Customer Service!Eventually, we contacted our credit card company and had the charges disputed and reversed.What an awful experience.","Date of stay: June 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Routinierter Standard ","Ein Hilton ist ein Hilton ist ein Hilton mit einem globalen Standard, der auf die Dauer langweilt. Das Geb√§ude ist scheu√ülich, die Lage aber sehr gut, bis zur Christuskirche, dem Independence Memorial Museum, Craft Market und Glockenturm sind es zu Fu√ü ein paar Minuten. Einchecken konnten wir erst am fr√ºhen Nachmittag, daf√ºr wurde das Zimmer am n√§chsten Tag dann erst um 17.00 Uhr gereinigt. Die Mini-Bar wird nur auf Bestellung aufgef√ºllt, weil es - so die Frau an der Rezeption -‚ÄûProbleme gab‚Äú, die sie nicht n√§her erl√§uterte. Immer sch√∂n, wenn Hotels ihren G√§sten das Gef√ºhl vermitteln, dass man sie eigentlich f√ºr Diebe h√§lt, die sich davon machen, ohne die Mini-Bar zu begleichen. An der ein oder anderen Stelle wirken die Zimmer leicht ramponiert, und sie k√∂nnten auch ein wenig reinlicher sein.  Der Service ist gehobener Durchschnitt. Traumhaft ist der Ausblick von der Dachterrasse, einer der besten Pl√§tze der Stadt, um den Sonnenuntergang zu genie√üen. Es gibt dort auch kleine Gerichte. Es kann aber sein, dass der Wei√üwein mal aus ist und das vor 22.00 Uhr.","Date of stay: January 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We were in our Honey Moon and we found our room decorated for the occasion with a really nice bottle of champagne, a card (Signed by several members of the team) and even a courtesy massage coupon. The room was big and very nice with all the comfort you can ask for. The breakfast was very good. Huge quality buffet with several options. The installations of the hotel are very nice and new. We wish that we had more time to enjoy the hotel.We were a bit in a hurry waiting for a suit to get steamed that supposed to be ready in 1 hour. But they solved everything at the reception.

"Best option for downtown Windhoek ","Stayed for 2 nights here on way to swapkomund.  This hotel has a lot of potential with good food, great location and an awesome skybar!  The staff needs better training for it to be a 5 star.  All rooms are very well done and up to date.Few examples of lack of staff training.  We needed a roll away bed and called for it.  Never came so called again.  Was told they don't have a sheet set or blanket so it wasn't possible.  But they never called to tell me this!!  And my kids are super tired and want to go to bed.  I think they just didn't want to do it cuz of the time.  No blankets in a hotel?Other things was calling for a pot of coffee and receiving a cup.

"Kurzaufenthalt mit verschiedenen Erlebnissen.","Die Lage ist im Zentrum. Gem√§ss Angaben das einzige, internationale Hotel. Richtig sch√∂n gross, beeindruckender Bau, der aus dem sonstigen Stil heraus stach.  Netter Empang durch die Portiers. Schnell und effizient. Wir hatten schliesslich einen 6 st√ºndige Kleinbus-Fahrt hinter uns.  Front Desk war langsam, nur weil wir 2 Zimmer mit 2 Betten wollten, welche schon so gebucht und vermerkt waren aber nicht so zugeteilt wurden. Im Normalfall ein Ziehen der Maus. Aber dies konnten die Mitarbeiter wohl nicht. Zimmer sind sch√∂n gross, WIFI sehr schell, Badezimmer gew√∂hnungsbed√ºrftig, da alles aus Glas und sehr offen. Viele hochwertige Amenities im Bad. Auch ein 2 TV war da. Ausblick des Zimmers war nicht besonders. Die Hauptstadt Namibias hatte noch nicht viel zu bieten. Dies wird sich sicherlich bald √§ndern. Das Abendessen war aber eher m√ºhsam. Muss eingestehen wir kamen auch sehr sp√§t, was aber nicht unsere Schuld war.Wir wurden an einen kleinen Tisch platziert. Speisekarte wurde gereicht, Wein und Wasser wurde sofort bestellt. Es dauert aber eher lang bis die Getr√§ke kamen. Das Essen wurde lang nicht aufgenommen. Wir musstne immer wieder rufen.Vorspeisen kamen und der Tisch war schon fast zu klein. Nach Brot und Butter mussten wir 2 mal fragen. Ein Beistelltisch wurde keiner gebracht. Aber auch ein gr√∂sserer Tisch wurde nicht angeboten, wenn auch viele freie Tische waren. Die Gerichte waren sch√∂n, die Steaks auf den Punkt gebraten. Service musste aber immer wieder gerufen werden, wenn wir etwas wollten. Nicht gerade G√§steorientiert. Wir verliessen das Restaurant nicht gl√ºcklich. Wir besuchten noch die Bar. Obwohl schon geschlossen, servierte man uns noch einen Drink und war sehr h√∂flich und zuvorkommend. Das hat das Bild des Hotels schon recht aufgewertet.Beim Fr√ºhst√ºck wurden wir nett und schnell empfangen. Die Speisen waren alle Frisch, oder wurden gerade √† la minute zubereitet. Grosse Auswahl. Der Kellner war super effizient, fragte immer wieder nach Getr√§nken, brachte frische S√§fte, Tee usw. Das Geschirr wurde immer wieder abger√§umt. Weshalb konnte dies am Vorabend nicht auch so sein. Auf dem Dach gabs eine Roof-Top Bar, Dazu ein Pool den ich leider nicht mehr brauche konnte.  Auch ein kleines aber sehr sch√∂nes Gym gabs mit vielen neuen Ger√§ten. Die Fahrt vom Zentrum zum Airport war dann ca. 40 Minuten.","Date of stay: February 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Really good city hotel.  ","It would be easy to find some minor faults with this downtown hotel, but the plusses vastly outweigh any negatives.   The breakfast buffet was as lavish as we've seen anywhere in the region.  There is a nice craft market one block away, and lots of interesting sites in close proximity.   The rooftop pool, bar, and executive lounge are really great -- but your level of enjoyment may be affected if there's a boisterous crowd.  For a short stop in the center of town, it's just right!","Date of stay: November 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Muy buena elecci√≥n","Pasamos 2 noches en este hotel, una a la llegada al pa√≠s y otra despu√©s de nuestro round trip.Es un hotel bonito y c√≥modo de ciudad. F√°cil de llegar desde la autopista sin tener que dar mucha vuelta para llegar. Hotel amplio con habitaciones grandes y c√≥modas. Ba√±o muy practico ya que est√° completamente integrado en la habitaci√≥n, a√∫n teniendo la privacidad de tener puerta en la zona de wc.Lo mejor del hotel es su zona se piscina y skybar. Perfecto para pasar un buen rato.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappointing - expectations not met","Apparently the best in town, despite having all the trappings of a Hilton, I was disappointed to find bedrooms (stayed in both a standard and Deluxe) had worn furniture (broken bedside cabinets, stained chairs); the beds were really uncomfortable; check in and out was painfully slow and not particularly welcoming.  Breakfast was great, though - lots of choice and good quality.  Food at the rooftop bar was also really tasty, and the service there was helpful and friendly.","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It's a Hilton","Stayed 2 nights after arrival in Namibia and one night before departing again. Nice comfortable rooms. Nothing negative. Enjoyed the sky-bar and the pool on 9th floor, but as always and everywhere it was annoying to see people occupying sun beds and chirs by putting their towles down and not using them.","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Points to improve","Its an excelente hotel except for the fact they allow people who are not guests in hotel to use the swimming pool area. These people arrive early and keep the best places reserved all day long. Today while I was waiting and hoping someone could leave a chair (impossible) I notice plenty of guests giving up of staying in the area. This is not correct, we guests pay a lot to stay in the hotel, we support the hotel and can not use the swimming pool because it is allowed people who are not in the hotel to take towel, etc. Next time I will stay in another hotel shipper and will do the same, spend the day in some one else hotel.","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton Hotel, Windhoek","A very nice surprise for a hotel which I thought was losing its sparkle. After many pleasant (and indifferent) stays at this hotel, I was about to give up and go somewhere else.  Due to a number of bad experiences, a few of my colleagues had already left for other hotels.  I'm glad I had decided to return and give the Windhoek Hilton another chance.

"Wonderful hotel!","We were a bit worried about finding our way to the hotel in the dark, but it is hard to miss on the main road in from the airport!  The staff were all extremely courteous and professional in every way. One member of staff accompanied us across the road to purchase a local SIM card, far above and beyond the call of duty! The room was beautifully appointed, immaculately clean, had everything you could wish for.  Breakfast was superb, one of the best spreads we have seen anywhere in the world.  We only used wifi in the public areas, and that seemed to work fine.

"Typisches Business/Stadthotel","Das Hilton befindet sich sehr zentral zur Innenstadt mit kleiner Einkaufsmeile, auch ist die Christuskirche gut zu Fu√ü zu erreichen,  was tags√ºber unter der Woche kein Problem ist. Parken kann man sicher in der Tiefgarage des Hotels. Das einchecken verlief schnell und sehr freundlich,  √ºberhaupt war das ganze Personal sehr nett und nicht wie mehrmals bem√§ngelt langsam.  Unser Zimmer war sehr gro√ü,  komfortabel eingerichtet,  sch√∂ner Blick auf die Kirche, und Museum.  Es sind aber rund um das Hotel Baustellen,  die zwar nicht sch√∂n anzuschauen sind, aber keine L√§rmbel√§stigung bedeuten.  Bett sehr gro√ü und bequem.  Badezimmer hat separate Dusche und WC plus Badewanne. Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet sehr viel Auswahl,  geschmacklich gut.Da wir nach unserer Anreise im Hilton waren,  haben wir den Nachmittag am Pool mit dazugeh√∂riger Skybar sehr genossen.  Sehr sch√∂nes Ambiente,  super Ausblick auf Windhoek, auch bei Nacht.

And being where it is, with Independence Avenue on its back, you can go walking easily to anywhere you want.Buffet Restaurant is very nice, with superb staff taking care of the guests. Excelletn food, to the localtaste, nicely spicy.Pool Deck and the Gym are ok. Pool is on rthe 9th floor, on the roof, so sun is hitting straight on you!

"Tampering with luggage","Stayed at the Hilton Windhoek for two nights in March 2016. Hotel design pleasing on the eye. Open spaces. Room was spacious with splendid balcony with two deck chairs and two loungers. However, room was not cleaned properly especially bathroom and toilet floor grimy. Towels and bed linen looked half washed. Carpets in passages dirty.On first night luggage was tampered with, nothing taken. On check out over heard another guest complain that a wrapped gift box that she handed to porter was opened. Tampering with guest luggage is a problem at this place.Had dinner and breakfast at Ekipa restaurant. Delicious, well presented food, buffet style with excellent selection of food. Service at Centrum restaurant very poor. Waited for an hour for veggie burger. Executive lounge nothing to write home about. Small room with handful of chairs and few snack dishes. Uninviting room. Had a look, walked away.Service at front desk okay.Hotel good for stopover.","Date of stay: March 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Central location and good facilities","Stayed here on business and found the hotel very wheelchair except for the steep ramp to the conference venue. Staff were extremely helpful and the conferencing facilities were top notch. Only downer was the POOR Wifi access for conference delegates. Food in the buffet adequate and rooms neat and comfortable. Very slow service in terms of room cleaning though. Spa staff were friendly and helpful and front desk were excellent. Suggestion: Work on the WIFI access - worth investigating adding this to the cost for conferencing as it would make your venue high in demand for conferencing in Windhoek. Much more wheelchair friendly than other hotels in Windhoek.","Date of stay: November 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice hotel","Staff were very friendly and the hotel itself is what I would expect from a Hilton property.  It was clean, well maintained and in a very good location to shopping and restaurants.  There is construction on both sides of the hotel, so it can get a bit noisy.  The executive lounge is nice, if not a bit small.  The roof deck does have great views of the city.One gripe was the key cards to the room-in a two day stay we had to get the cards reprogrammed 4 times, that was irritating.  I would still recommend the hotel.","Date of stay: November 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Konfortable Zimmer, m√§√üiger Service","Wir hatten das Hilton gebucht, weil wir abends in Windhuk ankamen und wir gem√§√ü der Angaben auf der Homepage im Hilton auch noch in verschiedenen Restaurants bis relativ sp√§t abends essen erhalten sollten. Als wir dann jedoch gegen 21 Uhr in eines der Restaurants gingen, wurde uns dort gesagt, dass die K√ºche bereits geschlossen sei - wir k√∂nnten aber √ºber den Zimmerservice etwas bestellen (ist das eine andere K√ºche?). Nun gut, auf unserem Zimmer lag aber keine Men√ºkarte f√ºr den Zimmerservice. Der Rezeptionist rief dann zun√§chst irgendwo an, damit uns eine Karte aufs Zimmer gebracht wird, ging dann aber selbst. Als er zur√ºckkam, sagte er uns, es w√§re bereits jemand auf dem Weg zu unserem Zimmer. Als wir wieder auf dem Zimmer waren, warteten wir jedoch vergeblich. Ein Anruf brachte uns dann den Hinweis, dass jemand bei uns war, wir aber nicht auf dem Zimmer - wir waren da wohl an der Rezeption, aber wieso stellt man uns die Men√ºkarte nicht vor die T√ºr? Weitere 15min sp√§ter wurde uns die Karte dann gebracht. Nach der Bestellung warteten wir wieder und gingen bereits davon aus, dass man uns vergessen hatte. Offenbar dauert es 45min um ein Sandwich zuzubereiten.Das aber nur als Anekdote. Das Zimmer war gro√ü, komfortabel, sauber. Internet auf dem Zimmer kostet leider extra und in der Lobby ist es sehr langsam. Die Lage ist gut, wobei man sich in Windhuk vermutlich ohnehin nicht lange aufh√§lt. Gefr√ºhst√ºckt haben wir nicht im Hotel, sondern im ""Bean there"" im Spar in der Maerua Mall. Das ist sehr zu empfehlen (leider kein TA-Link bisher). Das Hilton w√ºrde ich nur empfehlen, wenn man sp√§t landet und nicht mehr bei Dunkelheit √ºber Land fahren m√∂chte und auch dann gibt es vielleicht bessere Alternativen in Windhuk.","Date of stay: June 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Beware if you are running a meeting at this hotel.","We conducted an international meeting at the Windhoek Hilton last week.  Our experience was very mixed.  I would not recommend running a  meeting at this hotel unless their management significantly improves.  Cons: (1) For months prior to our meeting we tried from the U.S. to obtain a hotel contract for meeting and only finally got the contract the day we were leaving the hotel.  They did not respond or responded insufficiently to our multiple requests for the contract which delayed our ability to get visas for our international participants from across Africa and lead a number of our invitees not to be able to attend the meeting.  A month prior to the meeting did get some attention from the International Hilton office but that in the end didn‚Äôt really help.  Very frustrating and a tremendous waste of our staff time.(2) The projector that they provided for us was very old and outdated which meant that the wonderful powerpoint slides that our participants proudly brought to our meeting either couldn‚Äôt be read on the screen or looked like they had been faded in the desert sun.(3) Two of our participants had serious allergic  reactions to their rooms. The symptoms were reduced only when they opened their hotel room window.  Both lost their voices and had horrible congestion and coughs from the exposure.  Coincidently their  two rooms were next to each other on the third floor.  None of our other attendees had such a reaction.  Mold or a cleaning fluid was a possibility since there was mold around the shower of one of the rooms.(4) Fitness center was completely inadequate.  The two treadmills were broken for the week we were there, the one bicycle would only work when on the very lowest tension setting, the weights were very limited - but the two ellipticals did work.Pros:  Food was great, the hotel porters and room cleaning staff were great, the hotel has a beautiful interior and a wonderful top floor view of the city, and two of the the front desk managers were very helpful.","Date of stay: May 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"quasi 5 stelle","soggiornato nel febbraio 2015, hotel e' ben localizzato, con una vista sulla citta' e sulla chiesa cattolica, stanze grandi, , letto king size, bagno completo con vasca e doccia, ma con un difetto nel lavello :il rubinetto e' di design come pure il lavello, ma quest'ultimo e ' poco profondo, per cui dai un poco di pressione alla acqua rischi di bagnarti dalla cintola fino ai piedi.la stanza poi aveva gia' bisogno di alcune manutenzioni urgenti..la piscina all'ultimo piano , anche se  piccola ha un discrete spazio per prendere sole o solamente per un drink allo sky bar.Anche qui c'e' pero' un notevole errore:le chiavi elettroniche a carta di credito ( che una volta al giorno perdevano la loro funzionalita') servono per accedere ai piano, ma attorno alla piscine ho notato che la maggiorparte delle persone non erano ospiti dell'hotel.per ultimo, in un 5 stelle , non ho mai visto che il Wi-Fi della stanza fosse a pagamento e che nelle zone comuni ( hall-bar -ristorante) e' sufficente chiedere una password che permetteva di navigare gratuitamente per 8 ore.e veniva data a qualsiasi persona , anche senza dimostrare che si era ospiti della struttura","Date of stay: February 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"One of the best places I have ever stayed in","The best staff, bar, swimming pool, rooms, and facilities I have probably ever stayed in.0 complaints, and maybe a very minor one would be location. Though the location I think is perfect it is still within a reasonable walking distance from interesting places.I have no idea how this is not the #1 place in Windhoek but if this isn't the #1 then I really want to visit those other places because it is incredible how they can be higher than this.I believe most people's main complaint would be the price and I'm not sure about that since fortunately I had hhonors points to pay for my stay.","Date of stay: January 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton Windhoek","I stayed for one night and had a fantastic stay. The hotel staff was very firendly and helpful, and delivered an overall excellent service.

"Hilton Experience","The experience was good. I will stay at the Hotel again. I recommend other visitors to stay at the Hilton Hotel Windhoek Namibia. It is also family and children friendly. The security is good and the location is excellent. Thus, suitable for business as well. The day use facility is just ideal and convenient for short visits or transiting from the main airport.","Date of stay: December 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not Quite Ready for Prime-Time When We Visited (September 2014), But Real Possibilities!","The hotel was brand-new, and seemed not quite fully ready for prime time at the time we were there. The building is most impressive architecturally, with great design inside and out.                  Our room was, nonetheless, in some ways, daunting in terms of a rather confusing layout and a very modern bathroom that lacked real privacy (all-glass walls!). It definitely took some getting     used-to, and, to be fair, our one-night visit did not really allow for that. I would guess that a visit now or in the near future would be a better and more complete experience.","Date of stay: September 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good Hotel, Good Location","My trip was for business, where wifi is essential. The rate for wifi is extremely expensive but since the hotel was having problems they waived the fair which was a big bonus since the price to pay is very expensive.

"Very Nice Hotel","I stayed here for 1 night in April on a short visit to Namibia. While I am not the biggest fan of Hilton's, I choose this hotel for its location and also, the fact that the competition didn't look great. I was initially a little weary after reading some previous reviews on this site, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel and it exceeded my expectations.My room itself was very bright and spacious - it had everything I needed. The pool area was also very nice and I enjoyed at the bar overlooking the city - a very nice way to spend the late afternoon. It appeared to be a popular spot. The breakfast buffet was a typical Hilton affair - lots of choice and good quality.If I had one complaint, it would be a re-occuring Hilton one - lack of free wifi. The outrageous charge is impossible to justify today, yet you are left with no option but to pay it - as Hilton knows.","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Beautiful Hotel and very nice Staff","I had reservations to stay in the Hilton but there was a labor strike so I was put in another hotel down the street.  When I arrived in Windhoek I was notified that the strike was over and I was back in the Hilton.  The hotel is beautiful and so was my room.  My room was located on the 6th floor with a great view of the city.  Everything in the room worked and I did not have any issues or problems with my accommodations.  The staff was very friendly and polite.  The hotel has an excellent breakfast buffet.  I ate in the main restaurant three nights and the steaks and braised pork belly were excellent!  On the 9th floor is a roof top bar call the sky bar.  The views were wonderful and it is a great place to watch the sunset.I am not sure if it is true or not but I charged one of my meals to my room and I let the waitress know I was leaving a tip on the room tab.  She told me not to do that because the management takes ALL the tips that are left that way and on credit cards and divides them among all the waiters.  If this is true, I am not happy because my tip is for the individual that waits on me...not those that did not provide me the service.  I ended up bringing her cash the next day so she would get it.Also, I had to pay N$185 ($18.50 US) per day (24 hours) for WiFi.  This was crazy!  Come on Hilton.","Date of stay: December 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A much better standard of a Hilton, with some service issues","Located in the centre of town, this Hilton is ideally placed to get around Windhoek. When arriving by car, ensure you park under ground at the hotel and not what seems to be the car park next door in the open ground floor parking. You drive up to the hotel where the front desk can order taxis etc and helps with the bags. The reception area is large and impressive, the front desk staff on checkin and check out were very helpful. I was lucky being a gold member I got upgraded to the president suite so I can't comment on the rooms but my colleague said they were nice and new. On the first floor is the restaurant and bar area. Service in the bar was not great, closed at 11.30pm for last orders and at 11pm they would not even do coffees. There is a wine room which smells like it is also a smoking room and an outside bar area.The restaurant was large and looked impressive but we ate out. The room doors all face inwards in an american style hotel and have views outwards across the city. On the top floor is the exec lounge which is very small and with 10 people in there, there are no more seats. It has a fairly decent gym at the top, a roof pool with about 20 beds which is nice and a roof sky bar with glass protection from the wind. Overall a nice new modern hotel and worth staying at.","Date of stay: November 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good, but pricey for what it is.","The place is good: very clean rooms, great terrace bar and dining area. Modern, friendly staff. Location is a little isolated and far from fun dining areas. It is a good stop to start or end a Namibian trip. But it is difficult to get excited by this place.The reception area is always busy and you must patiently wait your turn. The immediate surrounding of the hotel are rather drab. \\Bottom line: It is OK, very expensive for what it is.

Staff was consistently nice and helpful. The hotel spoiled us by upgrading us to the diplomatic suite which is the size of an apartment. Very nice fixtures and decoration.  We enjoyed the executive club which bas great food. We also had drinks at the rooftop bar from which we enjoyed the view and the cool breeze at night.","Date of stay: August 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Fabulous newish hotel in town","Having stayed at the Kalahari Sands on a previous visit 6 years ago, I was pleased to see a new hotel in town. I was certainly not disappointed. From the moment you walk into the reception, through to the detail in the standard hotel rooms, everything is as you would wish it to be, and very nicely designed. The Sky Bar and pool (more plunge than swimming) are a nice touch on the roof. Only downside was the organisation for the  meeting room - very slow to organise water and internet which was included in the package, but I got an immediate apology from the hotel as soon as I submitted their own questionnaire. Would certainly stay there again.","Date of stay: July 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Guter Stopp mitten in der Stadt","Das Hotel wurde Anfang 2011 er√∂ffet und liegt so zentral, dass man sein Auto in der Tiefgarage lassen kann (5‚Ç¨ pro Tag) und fast alles zu Fu√ü unternehmen kann. Die Standardzimmer sind sehr ger√§umig und modern eingerichtet mit 2 Kingsize-Betten und einem sch√∂nen Badbereich. Deutsches Fernsehen wird angeboten. Wir waren schon einmal hier vor 18 Monaten und dieses Mal etwas entt√§uscht, da das sch√∂ne Abendbuffet nicht mehr stattfindet. Es gibt eine gro√üe Speisenkarten mit durchaus ordentlichen Preisen f√ºr die Menus. Die Getr√§nkepreise sind abgehoben. Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist allerdings vom Feinsten und dort klappt auch der Service.Unversch√§mt teuer ist das WLAN mit 15‚Ç¨ pro Tag! Man kann auch nur  f√ºr 7‚Ç¨ eine Stunde online gehen, sich aber dabei nur einmal einloggen. Das ist Internet-Steinzeit und unw√ºrdig f√ºr ein Hilton-Hotel.Der Pool mit Bar in der 9.Etage ist zwar sehr sch√∂n, aber auch sehr stark benutzt.

"Best in Windhoek.....slim pickings though","Nice modern Chinese built hotel (looks like it is in Beijing)....very modern, but Chinese built, so ...falling down a little already!Exposed wires in my bathroom, no security lock on the door, flooding shower, etc...but all LOOKED nice. Food was horrible and never correct in the restaurant or room service (both involved a nice 2 hour wait for the wrong food, which was BAD), but you know what? This is Africa and this is the best hotel in Windhoek, so frankly I dont care!I was just happy for a cool, western hotel - and the staff are superb and so nice. Free parking too!I especially want to say that Mario and Mark in the executive lounge are stellar!

On the third night, the night before we flew to Zambia, we were upgraded. What a wonderful surprise. Pity we hadn't had more time in our room...ah suite. It has a great breakfast and dining choices.

"The Executive Lounge and its staff really make this place - without them it's just so-so...","I stayed at the Hilton while in Windhoek on business.  It's a very nice new hotel - everything you expect of a five star place in terms of facilities - so it all looks very stylish and luxurious...The service level at the hotel is inconsistent, however.  I give them a five based on the service in the executive lounge and the staff that work in the lounge (also the concierge is excellent and the reception service is ok).  These are the people I mainly dealt with - they get a five - everyone else doesn't deserve that, but as I said I didn't really deal with everyone else too much...The executive lounge is on the top floor (along with a pool and related bar).  It has a private reception desk and staff.  The staff in the lounge are excellent.... there is no other word...They remember your name, what you like to eat or drink, they are welcoming, attentive, hospitable and can do most things for you without you having to deal with the public reception desk.  They serve cocktails and some light food complimentary in the lounge every evening, and they also do breakfast there - so if you go to this hotel you should definitely get an executive room so you have lounge access. The service in the hotels public restaurants and bars is not good.....On my first morning, I went down to the main restaurant for breakfast - it was about 8:45am.While there were ample staff on duty, many of the tables were dirty - they had been occupied and not reset.  The breakfast was a buffet setup laid out in front of an open kitchen.  I was very surprised to find that the buffet line was out of scrambled eggs and sausages - plus some other things.... at first I thought i had my time wrong and they must be closing for the day!!There were two cooks in the kitchen but the entire time I was there I don't think those dishes were replenished....A restaurant manager was nowhere in sight and the staff seemed mainly occupied with socializing with one another....I had a similar experience with the hotel's 'sports bar' one evening.  The service was inattentive and slow despite their being ample people on duty.... Needless to say I didn't really go to the hotels main restaurants or public bars after those experiences!!Anyway, as I said, get an executive room, use the executive lounge facilities and rely on the employees there and you will have a fine time - I recommend the hotel (provided you have the executive room).","Date of stay: June 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I'll be back!","Booked a very last-minute trip when my husband was granted some unexpected days off work.Arranged transfer from the airport through the hotel which was punctual and comfortable.We had a room in the ""tower"" part of the hotel. Very spacious, clean and modern with a superb king-size bed and nice sitting area with comfy chairs and a table. More than adequate wardrobe and drawer space.Loved the bathroom with it's ""rain"" shower. We chose not to make use of the huge bathtub ( trying to be ""green"" and conserve water ) but it was tempting!The breakfast buffet was among the best I have sampled anywhere. Good selection of hot and cold food and most importantly, really good coffee, a rarity in many hotels imo. Dinner was good value for money also (with a bread and butter pudding to die for!)Everywhere appeared clean and well maintained. Service was always with a smile and help readily and willingly given if required.Well done Hilton Windhoek......can't wait for our next visit!","Date of stay: April 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A very good upmarket business hotel.","We stayed one night at the end of our Namibia trip ‚Äì and to be honest the only reason we did was the exceptional room rate I got. The room was great and the rooftop pool perfect for chilling out after the drive down. Our arrival from 2 weeks travelling coincided with the expected arrival of the President to visit a conference being held at the hotel. The speed with which our (very dirty) car was removed and we were whisked down the red carpet and out of sight without in any way feeling aggrieved says much for the tact and humour of the staff. Well recommended ‚Äì if the price is right.","Date of stay: November 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Chic style in Namibia?","If you are looking for an Africa experience, skip it. But it you want a true 4 star westernized-urban business-like hotel in downtown Windhoek then go for it. Did this whole place just drop into Namibia? Very lovely modern setting, room decoration is strange with bathtub open to the whole room. Roof top deck is fantastic, but small.  BEWARE of flaky wifi service that only works in some seats in the lobby, does not work in the rooms or roof top deck. Internet in the room is plug in...no plug on an iPad or smart phone so worthless for me. And they charge for internet access - annoying.","Date of stay: July 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"An ageing Hilton, but definitely a good option.","Windhoek doesn't have much high end hotel space.  This is one of the few options, and by international standards it is cheap - $150 per room level.Pro- big rooms- Executive lounge is excellent if you have access- Rooftop pool, gym and bar is a good space- we stayed 2x in one week, and the second time upgraded to the Presidential Suite.  It was not more than twice a normal room, and hilariously lavish.  Upgrading your room here is worth it.- loved the breakfast juice bar (choose raw fruit and veg for your custom juice)Cons- restaurant does not have great ambience (although the wagyu beef is delicious and reasonably priced)- the rooms are tired,  but perfectly fine.   I can see why a refurb is not viable at the v low room rates in Windhoek.That I stayed the 2nd time in one week proves I  recommend.","Date of stay: August 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Poor service give it amiss","Clean hotel, good breakfast. Service on check in and the sky at was shocking. We had to stays here on arrive to Namibia and on departure. The first one was ok, bags taken and reception quick. The service on the sky bar was slow to the point that we decided not to stop. On our return for a day stay, no one to help with bags to the room, check in took 30 min with a wait to get served and the sky bar was shocking. Not open on time, had to ask for service back at reception and the. Limited availability of the menu.

"Awesome Hospitality","The hotel is located at the heart of the beautiful city of Windhoek which makes it very convenient to get around. Most of the historic sites and the tourist attraction in the City are within rich. The rooms are so tidy and spacious. The highspeed internet makes working from  the hotel very comfortable. The staff are charming. The food is really good. The skybar is a place to be. You see all the corners of Windhoek  while enjoying a cold one. I highly recommend Hilton Hotel and Resorts in Windhoek. You will most likely get awesome hospitality.","Date of stay: November 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great Place to stay","The place is located in the center of Windhoek.The rooms are very nice although a bit of renovation would be required.The service is very good from the reception to the restaurant.

"The Very Good and Very Bad","It is simple really. I stayed at the Hilton Windhoek in November 2012. The hotel is modern, with excellent rooms and facilities. However, I was asked to pay N$185 per night for WiFi access, which I was prepared to do, as stated on the Hilton's website. When I got to the hotel and tried to access the internet, I realized that it is PER DEVICE. In other words, if you have a smart phone and a computer, you had to pay N$185 per device, per night, so that would be N$370 per night. Needless to say if you have any other wireless device, it would be N$185 more per device, per night.I could not believe that in 2012 a brand such as the Hilton was misleading customers in offering WiFi broadband, but when you get to the hotel it is per device, which, in my view, defeats the purpose and the average person who stays at the hilton will have at least two devices.I have asked the Hilton to make that policy clear on its website, hopefully they will do so.Outside of that the hotel was very good. Some staff needs further training, but they were always polite and tried to address my needs.","Date of stay: November 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Possibly the worst service ever","While the hotel is nice enough, the staff have really soured the experience from the word go.Despite being a Hilton Honors member, I felt that my patronage was not appreciated and the lack of friendly and professional courtesy has left me feeling like I never want to support the Hilton brand ever again.To top it, the food is very average and expensive.","Date of stay: November 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Terrible stay in a Hilton. Don't book it!","I visited this Hotel in March, on the way to Namibia. It was really terrible, so terrible that it was almost funny. First, we arrived with the car and dropped the car to the valet parking... but none of the valet had a driving license. The took time to find a guy with a license to move the car. Then the room was not clean at all, the shower was disgusting, we even found rubbish in the wastebasket! We reported it, but no one took care. At 11pm, we decided to take a drink. The bar in the first floor just closed, but they asked us to visit the second bar in the 9th floor. Arrived there, they told us that they'd close as well. Result: Not possible to take a drink at 11pm... not 3am, 11pm! Incredible. But it was not the worse. Don't expect to sleep even 10 mins in this terrible hotel, because on each side, you have the redlight with the noisy system for blind pedestrian, and you get a beep-beep every 30 seconds in the whole night. Avoid it!","Date of stay: March 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Irref√ºhrende Werbung","Das Einchecken war professionell. Das gesamte Service-Personal ist hervorragend ausgebildet und serviceorientiert. Unser Mietwagen wurde in die Tiefgarage (5,- ‚Ç¨ pro Nacht) gefahren und bei der Abreise wieder zur Weiterreise bereitgestellt. Wir hatten ein Gartenzimmer mit 60 m¬≤ gebucht, mussten aber feststellen, dass es sich bei dem Zimmer um ein normales Hotelzimmer mit 30 m¬≤ handelte. Die dazugeh√∂rige Terrasse mit ebenfalls 30 m¬≤ wurde bei der Gesamtgr√∂√üe dazugerechnet. So war das in der Hotelzimmerbeschreibung nicht vermerkt. Zimmer funktional eingerichtet, Abnutzungserscheinungen nicht zu √ºbersehen. Das W-Lan funktionierte einwandfrei. Die Club-Lounge in der obersten Etage ist relativ klein und bietet nur wenigen G√§sten Platz. Die angebotenen Speisen (18.00 bis 20.00 Uhr) waren in Ordnung, ebenfalls der Wein. Das Fr√ºhst√ºcks-B√ºfett war nicht zu beanstanden. Das Hotel befindet sich direkt in der Innenstadt und alle Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten sind fu√ül√§ufig erreichbar. Fazit: Das neuwertige Hotel mit gutem Service und einem hervorragenden Preis-/Leistungsverh√§ltnis kann weiterempfohlen werden.","Date of stay: February 2020This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Mostly very good","The hotel is easy to drive to from international airport and it has secure parking on site at cost of ND 60 per day.  It is within walking distance of National Museum of Namibia, although we were not sure it would be comfortable to walk around in evening.  There is a restaurant on site. There is a Super Spa Shop within an easy 5 -10 mins drive for anyone wanting to get provisions before setting off on a trip ithrough Namibia.   It is also very easy to access the B1 down to Sossusvlei and up to Etosha from here. Sky Bar on roof is an excellent open air location for a sundowner. Seating.....and a small plunge type pool (although possible to do some widths if no-one else is in it).   There was also spa and gym, which we did not use so cannot comment. Room (deluxe) was very large.  Equipped with fridge, aircon, hairdryer, toiletries, iron and board, a safe. We stayed here 2 nights at the start of our trip at the beginning of Sept 2019 and one night at the end (19th).  The first two nights the staff were exceptional.  They made our first experience of Namibia a very positive and welcoming one. Zeroline on reception needs a special mention - she is an excellent ambassador for Hilton and did a fantastic job of making our stay enjoyable. Also the woman who supervised the executive lounge on our first two nights (2 and 3rd sept).   On our return on 19th the staff were polite but did not provide as much of a welcoming experience. We were a bit surprised when the executive lounge was all packed not long after 8pm on our third night, as we were under the impression drinks would still be available until 10pm??Breakfast is buffet style with lots of choice. Eggs and omelette cooked on request. Other hot items, including pancakes. Fresh squeezed juices of several types. Pastries, continental breakfast items, toast, cereal, bottled water, tea, coffee. Served early and until about 10.30am.  There were no problems getting seated on arrival at the restaurant. There is some outside seating area and place where you can get a coffee and cake during the day. Overall I would recommend Hilton in Windhoek.  I haven‚Äôt given it 5 stars as there were some small areas for further improvement - chipped cup in room, small points where room beginning to look slightly tired in places, such as stained carpet, etc,  lift bell could be heard in room and some noisy guests banging doors late at night (although 2 out of 3 nights guests were quiet), staff friendliness was not consistent over our two stays.","Date of stay: September 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Theft","I have resided many times in this hotel. Unfortunately it gets worse. Bad customer service. Rip off and the waitresses sign bills on my room even though I did not consume it. That is theft. After room cleaning they do not close my room so that anybody can walk in my room. The car service offered is a complete rip off and the drivers do their own deals with the hotel guests. Complaints at the reception do not help. Also this old white manager (didn't get his name) is completely useless. Never again Hilton hotel in Windhoek. The Thule Hotel will do it.","Date of stay: February 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great hotel in downtown Windhoek","Just back from a trip to Namibia.  Stayed at the Hilton in downtown Windhoek on 2 separate occasions after arriving and again just before leaving the country.  Both were great experiences.  It is a beautiful hotel in a great location accessible to major tourist sites such as the Namibia Craft Centre.  I had a ‚Äúgarden‚Äù room the second stay which had a beautiful, desert-landscaped garden on my balcony.  Staff were very nice and helpful.  Rooms are well appointed.  Laundry service good.  Executive lounge on the 9th floor was great with breakfast and a light dinner including alcohol provided.  Prices are very reasonable.  Definitely recommend it!","Date of stay: October 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ok","F√ºr das Hotel sprich das sehr freundliche Personal und die Lage, auch wenn es in Windhoek nicht wirklich viel zu sehen gibt. √Ñrgerlich war, das das ‚Äúdo-not-disturb‚Äù Zeichen mehrfach nicht beachtet wurde, diesen Fauxpas macht auch ein vielfaches ‚Äúsorry‚Äù nicht wett. Das Zimmer, das ich mir selbst √ºber die HHonors App ausgesucht habe, kann ich nicht empfehlen (812). Das Wifi ist qu√§lend langsam, am ehesten noch auf dem WC nutzbar. Direkt neben der Zimmert√ºr befindet sich der Eingang zum Housekeeping, der nat√ºrlich gut frequentiert wird. Daf√ºr sind Aussicht, Air condition und Zimmergr√∂sse sehr gut. Ein B√ºgeleisen ist vorhanden, aber leider konnte ich keinen Schuhanzieher finden. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist durchaus ansprechend, die Executive Lounge in der 9. Etage nett und ausreichend best√ºckt. Die viel gelobte rooftop Bar wird sp√§testens zur blauen Stunde sehr voll und sehr laut, nicht nur durch die musikalische Beschallung. In Ruhe ein Glas Wein trinken kann man dort nicht. Die Taxipreise von und zum Flughafen sind unterschiedlich. Am Flughafen steht gleich au√üerhalb des Geb√§udes ein M√§nnlein mit Weste und Schreibblock, der das Ziel zu den Akten nimmt und sich einen der Fahrer greift. Ihm wird alles erkl√§rt, auch der bei Ankunft zu zahlende Betrag von 300NAD (ca. 22‚Ç¨) - ohne Diskussion. Das muss der Fahrer beim Mann mit der Weste quittieren, mit Unterschrift nat√ºrlich. Vom Hotel zur√ºck werden 358NAD f√§llig, weil man von einem der im Haus arbeitenden Hertz Mitarbeiter gefahren wird. Das geht sehr schnell und freundlich, auch hier bitte quittieren mittels Unterschrift - m√∂glichst mit kurzem Feedback! Fahrzeit 40-50‚Äô","Date of stay: March 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A typical Hilton experience - good but with one bad episode!","The hotel is about a 40 minute drive from the airport. Staff is friendly and the rooms were clean and neat. The hotel was definitely great value for money. I only had an issue with the airport drop. Initially, I had booked a drop for 4 am. However, the night before, I decided to leave an hour earlier for the airport i.e. at 3 am. So, I went to the hotel reception at 11 pm and requested the reception to reschedule my airport drop for 3 am instead of 4. Despite a long conversation, the hotel reception told me that it was not possible to reschedule the time as the drivers and the transport company's manager would be sleeping and they could not wake them up. I found this absurd. I have always been used to 24/7 service, and especially expect a 5 star hotel to be able to manage such a simple request such a rescheduling an airport drop by one hour, but they didn't. Eventually, I had to request another colleague of mine and squeeze into his car (which was leaving at 3 am) with all our bags, and go to the airport. I definitely felt quite panicky about missing my flight, since the hotel was least cooperative with my request. In terms of the property rating, i'm still giving this hotel a good mark. However, this episode definitely left a bad taste in the mouth. Lesson is: at the Hilton, Windhoek you must plan very well in advance about your airport drops.","Date of stay: July 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Sehr komfortabel und super Lage","Alle Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten fu√ül√§ufig erreichbar. Hotel selbst sehr sch√∂n.Zimmer sch√∂n gro√ü mit Dusche und Badewanne und tollem Blick auf die Independence Ave. Au√üergew√∂hnlich gutes und reichhaltiges Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet - sogar Obsts√§fte kann man sich je nach Gusto zusammenstellen und frisch pressen lassen.

"So Much Potential But So Many Problems...","After checking in to the Hilton for a couple days before heading out for a safari, my wife and I had so much hope for an uneventful stay as we were celebrating our 33rd anniversary.  An impressive facility and probably one of the finest hotels in Windhoek (if not THE finest), Christian checked us in at the front desk and was the epitomy of professionalism, acknowledging my elite status with Hilton as well as recognizing our anniversary, which had been noted on the reservation.  He was complimented by Victor, who took our bags to the room and was extremely pleasant and articulate.  The evening passed without incident but we weren't quite as lucky the following day. The first problem was the internet with an outrageous charge of $18 but slow as molasses and certainly not worth the price.  Since there are no instructions in the room, I plugged the ethernet cable into my laptop and signed in without problem, but actually gave up on trying to check my email after waiting for 15 minutes without being able to bring up a single website.  I finally called the front desk and was told that they would have their internet technician check it out and call me back.  I waited another 30 minutes before calling again and got an apology and a promise that they would send someone right up.  Another 15 minutes passed and I finally went down to the front desk and Aubrey came out of the back office and followed me to my room.  He immediately diagnosed the problem as being the ethernet cable which needed to be unplugged after I signed on and was connected to wi-fi.  But how would I have known that without instructions and why couldn't someone just tell me that when I called if that's all it took? Aubrey apologized and asked me to call him directly if I had any more internet problems, which I didn't.But, shortly thereafter my wife realized that housekeeping had failed to replenish the soap or leave bath clothes when they cleaned the room so I called housekeeping and was again assured that both would be sent right up, to no avail.  We finally gave up and left for a couple of hours thinking that the soap and bath clothes would certainly be in the room when we got back.  NOT!  So I called again and the young lady who answered sensed my frustration and apologized and said she'd leave her post at the desk and bring them up herself as soon as she could, which she did.  But, again, why does everything take at least two calls?The only bright spot other than Christian and Victor at checkin was Francy who patiently worked with me to solve a problem with our tour and literally saw it through to the end and a timely and successful resolution.  In conclusion, this property has so much potential and a great staff but they just need more direction and customer service training. As a former hotelier and Director of Finance for Marriott Hotels International and Choice Hotels I know the importance of one call resolution of guest problems and complaints if the property intends to keep its clientele coming back again and giving recommendations to friends, colleagues and relatives.  But apparently the management at the Windhoek Hilton thinks that they are the best game in town so customer retention isn't an issue.  I can only hope they're right.  We are leaving for safari tomorrow but will be back for an overnight stay in a week and can only hope that everything goes off without a hitch. Regardless, I can't say that I could recommend this property as I Can't be confident that the service issues that we've experienced and others have expressed will be addressed and rectified.","Date of stay: July 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good but some drawbacks","Good.The rooms lovely. Spacious. Great beds. The interior very modern and just up to my liking. The staff very helpful and always alert. The breakfast amazing. Loved the freshly squeezed fruit juices. The roof bar was also very nice.Not so good:Sometimes the staff seemed to be confused. Booked transportation to the airport. Found out it was not booked. Booked again. Not booked. We managed the third time. The lunch order was not correct. I ordered a burger without majo, got it. Sent it out. Got it back without majo and without other staff, that I wanted. And the meat was cold....not acceptable for a five star hotel. They charged me twice for the same laundry. No excuse. Overall, I wouldn't rate this hotel as a five star one. Rather a four star.However, I will probably come back","Date of stay: October 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"What a joke","If you love horrible customer service and none of your concerns addressed like asking three times for extra towels for your kids, asking 2 different people to replace a bathroom light bulb and it never getting done in 3 days, or getting stuck in the elevator for over 30 minutes, or carpet cleaning outside of your room at 10pm, or waiting forever for food at the sky bar or even ketchup or to even order for that matter‚Ä¶..then this is the place for you. The breakfast is great but that was it.","Date of stay: May 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not equivalent to a 5 star","There was some really good things like friendly staff. But breakfast selection is extremely poor and they make you pay extra for an americano and the actual filter coffee is horrible. The housekeeping also wasn't grand and up to standards of 5 star. Won't stay here again.","Date of stay: December 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"World traveler","We stayed here overnight on our way to northern Namibia between flights. We arrived at about 6pm and went up to the sky bar for a drink and dinner before an early night as we had to catch an early flight the next morning. We purchased a drink and ordered a pizza as we thought that would be quick and easy.  This wasn‚Äôt the case. After an hour of waiting we told the bar staff that we had to go to bed early. We then rang room service when we returned to our room to get a pizza there. We were told that it would be a long wait so we then asked for a bowl of chips and we were told we would be charged extra for room service! I questioned this and made them aware of our experience at the bar. The surcharge was then dropped. I was willing to put that behind me as a one off bad experience.The next morning at 5am when we checked out we waited in line to check out as a trainee and another receptionist were slowly processing each person. To top it all off a customer pushed in front of me as he had to go and catch a plane!!! We were all in the boat! Surely they know that a lot of customers are in transit and catch early flights why put a trainee on at a busy time!I would expect much more from a hotel in this chain and as a result I will never stay at this chain again. I accept it was Namibia but surely Hilton hotels have a reputation to uphold world wide!","Date of stay: May 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comfortable but some problems","Pros:Modern hotel in a central location. The room was clean, spacious and well equipped. Maid service was very efficient and items were replenished quickly.Breakfast was excellent and the selection was impressive. Staff at breakfast were polite and quick to assist. Coffee was good. The pool area was pleasant, clean and there were towels available. Food at the Skybar was tasty and well priced for a hotel bar. Cons:The wifi was very bad. It barely worked in the room and did not work at all at the pool. It would be impossible to work from this hotel. 1 out of 3 elevators worked, so the wait to get to the pool and/or your room could be upwards of 10 minutes. This was very frustrating. The pool area was pleasant but had very limited seating space. Non-residents are allowed to use the poo areal, which was frustrating, as it meant that residents could not get a seat. I don't think this is acceptable when you're paying a significant amount of money to stay there. Drinks at the Skybar were disappointing: the cocktails were bland and overpriced. Stick to the beers. Staff were hit and miss. Some staff were great, but a rude receptionist spoiled our check in. The hotel are reluctant to assist you in booking a local taxi/excursion and will only help secure their own services (which are grossly overpriced). All in all, could do better.","Date of stay: January 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Diplomatic Treatment in the Diplomatic Suite","Fantastic experience. Not much to do in Windhoek but the hotel and amenities were wonderful. We were in the Diplomatic suite, which was very spacious and comfortable. Definitely a winner. The Ekapi restaurant provided the most delicious meals - well done to the chef and kitchen staff. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. A wonderful, restful time spent in Windhoek.","Date of stay: November 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not worth the money spent.","With half the price there are plaves in Windhoek which would delight you and Hilton isnt one of them. The food at Hilton is just there, cant be called the best in town. Rooms are smelly specially the linen, carpets are dirty. If you are looking for wifi, you cant run a netflix or skype over it as its from dialup days. Pity my idea and expectationa from Hilton are completely over now.","Date of stay: August 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Niemals wieder!  ","Wir haben viele Jahre bei jedem Aufenthalt in Windhoek im Hilton √ºbernachtet. Leider wird es immer schlechter. Buchungen werden nicht bearbeitet  - vielleicht vergessen? - der Service und die Sauberkeit sind unfassbar schlecht. Dieses Mal, als Kr√∂nung,  hatten wir wie immer ein Doppelzimmer gebucht,  ein Einzelzimmer bekommen... auch auf Beschwerden und Nachfragen reagiert niemand. Das Zimmer war nicht sauber, Dreck und Seifenreste vom Vorg√§nger in der Dusche, Blutflecke auf der Matratze, es war weder gesaugt, noch die Schr√§nke,  Spiegel,  Waschbecken geputzt.  S√§mtliche - eigentlich gl√§nzende Dinge - waren schmierig und klebrig.  Auf die Aussagen des Personals, insbesondere an der Rezeption,  kann man sich nicht verlassen.  Es wird alles versprochen, sich entschuldigt,  aber mehr passiert auch nicht. Urlauber werden beim Betreten des Gel√§ndes gescannt und gefilzt, die Prostituierten durchgewunken. Man kennt sich ja..... abends auf der Dachterrasse versuchen diese Damen dann ein gutes Gesch√§ft.... unfassbar f√ºr ein Hilton!  Es wundert mich sehr, dass an diesem Hotel noch der Name Hilton dranstehen darf. Wir werden nicht wiederkommen.","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Excellent location in Windhoek ","I stayed here for two nights prior to going on safari. The hotel is in an excellent location to explore Windhoek been right in the center of the city and within walking distance of the major attractions. The view from the rooftop bar and swimming pool are stunning and highly recommended for sundowners. The executive lounge is great with a great choice of snacks and drinks. I would definitely try and stay here again if I am back in town.","Date of stay: June 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It's all about location and service ","On a short family vacation to Windhoek and surroundings. Had some points to use and the reviews were mostly good. Hotel is situated in the city center. Modern style hotel with the expected amenities. Overall service was good and prompt. Room was decent size. Had to get used to the bathroom open concept (shower). Eating options good to above average for a hotel. Main restaurant provides √† la carte and evening buffet with themes. Breakfast buffet has a good selection and above average. Roof top bar and pool is one the main attractions of the hotel. Great view of the city and beyond. Main current drawback is the construction of the sister hotel right beside which generates some noise (not too much) but affects the view. Hotel is walking distance from a few attractions including Namibia craft center and craft cafe (worth trying), national museum and Christ church. A couple of restos in the area too. To go beyond best to use taxis or own transport. Overall highly recommended hotel. Will stay there again.","Date of stay: April 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not impressed, pretty basic","positive: -downtown location-very friendly staff negative:-run down rooms although only 5 years old-bathrooms have no doors, you can watch your travel companion walk out of shower or brushing teeth etc. while you are in bed or watch TV.when bathroom lights switched on at night you have light in whole room- dirty plastic flower in bathroom is only decoration, even in ""diplomatic suite"" 600- windows inside the room very dirty, rain running from ceiling at window inside the room-windows can not be opened- rooms in tower annex have obstructed view due to ""decoration"" metal elements in fron of window- during my 2 day stay only 1 to 2 out of 3 elevators were working. according to other guests a problem existing for years. Annoying at evening when rooftop is a busy hotspot with local young crowd.-expensive wifi, when you book via travel agent and are not Hilton HHonors Member. (so you have to sign up and book at Hilton.com to get free wifi which you would get at any hostel for free anyway)- when you ask at front desk for a city taxi, they will use the Hertz Limousine service based in their lobby, even when there are taxi drivers around.All together I was rather disappointed. The Windhoek Hilton is the only Hilton I did visit not offering any special appreciation to Diamond Members. Not even any real flower, some sweet surprise or wine as other Hilton Hotels give to their most loyal customers.As recently the biggest shareholder of Hilton became chinese, I hope that the Hilton Windhoek does not only offer Furniture and Cosmetics made in China but also do bring over their Managers from China, were all Hilton Hotels are real 5 Star.A plastic flower in the room in a 5 Star Hotel definitely shows that the General Manager or his assistant never walk up their rooms.The dirty windows may also be a proof for that negligence.","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Still a great hotel","This time I did not get a room with a view. Ask for one. I had a building sight. Around the hotel walking was difficult. I walked to and from the office and the pavements around the hotel are not great.The rooms are great. I will stay there again on my next visit.The breakfast did not disappoint. Excellent breakfast coffee (which is rare in most hotels).I had in room dining this time. The main was good, the desert was exceptional. I had a nut, brownie/mouse. Can't recall exactly what it was called. I don't have a sweat tooth and it was exceptional.","Date of stay: February 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Poor facilities but great rooms","Had trouble checking in as their rooms were full. Had to use the ""spa"" area for freshening up before meeting - the shower room was dirty with empty shower gel bottles, hair, and stained towels. The rooftop bar is lovely though, with a nice outdoor pool, and the gym is open 24/7. However, most of the equipment is broken or in need of maintenance, but it's still good for a quick basic workout.The rooms are great with lots of space, all necessary equipment and amenities. Shower gel, conditioner, lotion etc. The location is also good. The reception are good at organising taxis and help for anything you may need. The gym and spa area, and the checking in problems, need to be dealt with however.","Date of stay: September 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"price of a 4 star, service of a 2 star hotel","Music from their Bar or club was clearly heard, our bedroom was on the second floor. Construction work opposite our bedroom was not mentioned. We were awoken by drilling machine noises at 7am. We practically had to beg for one more shower gel (though a double room was booked for 2) upon arrival then again in the morning since it was not brought the night before. There were no bathrobes in the room. We also had to ask for the dental kit twice upon arrival and next morning. We arrived by car, the receiving employees make less attempt to explain where the guest parking places are. I intentionally spoke to them in one of Namibia vernaculars (when I noticed Oshikwanyama accent in the one who tried to help, to his relief) to see how they treat locals. Yes, there is a difference. Having worked as a Service Checker in Switzerland, it wasn't difficult to spot areas of improvements. If Hilton Namibia is to demand European prices, then they should provide the same service standard as in Europe. The place is full now because it is new but risks loosing customers if it service remain worse than that of a simple Guest Farm in Namibia.  For us it was a one night test on our way to the airport. I would not want to be on a business trip here with all the noise and poor service. One have to pay to use Wifi in the room. The internet speed is still way way too slow.","Date of stay: February 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Satisfactory stay","Excellent new hotel. Check-in was fast and efficient. Room on the Executive floor very well appointed and clean. I liked the bathroom arrangement as it makes the area light, spacious and airy. Good bed, lots of power outlets, fridge and good view from window.Rooftop pool area quite small but lovely for the views. Nice bar for sunset drinks.Nice Executive lounge with two hours of light food and generous drinks in the evening. Service excellent.Dinner at the Ekipa restaurant was good and service efficient despite there being a lot of parties going on. Breakfast in the Executive lounge a bit restricted but the waiter offered to fetch food from the buffet in the main restaurant. Again service excellent and very friendly. Location good with a Chequers supermarket just across the street.Reception staff very helpful and went to a lot of trouble to sort out a problem I had with locating my rental car. My only negative is the cost of the wifi. Usually it is free in rooms on an executive floor.","Date of stay: November 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Pathetic Room Service","The room service was absolutely terrible at this hotel. I had to leave my room, get into my car and buy food at a garage because room service did not return 2 of the calls I made.  Another warning that prospective guests should be aware of is a letter they leave in front of your door when you're still a guest of the hotel asking you to pay an outstanding amount if it exceeds 4000 Namibian Dollars. I was absolutely offended by this because they're insinuating that I would not be able to make the payment","Date of stay: November 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Fine but nothing special","We booked our trip to Namibia late and sadly couldn't get into the Olive Grove which was our first choice.  The Hilton was fine as a place to rest our heads after travelling from London but it was nothing special.  The room was comfortable and clean, breakfast perfectly nice - really exactly what you'd expect from any 4 star chain hotel.  Treat it just as a convenient stopover before your Namibian adventure begins and you won't be disappointed.","Date of stay: August 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Best in town","Unfortunately the initial welcome wasn't very friendly by the lady at the front desk, however overall the room and the dining area made up for it.Dinner was average, but after dinner drinks at the skyline bar was the highlight of the visit. With a 12th floor pool deck, amazing city skyline, and mature crowd, it made for good end to the night.","Date of stay: January 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Modern and Well Appointed","Only stayed for one night on business.From the moment you walk in, you notice that this is a new hotel and very modern.Reception service was very good.Rooms are fantastically appointed and decorated.I never had time to dine at the hotel, nor enjoy the popular Sky Bar, which is a bar on the roof of the hotel. Apparently a great place for a sundowner or a drink under the stars.Would definitely stay there again on my next trip!","Date of stay: July 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Top quality hotel - Service still developing","We stayed one night and pre-booked direct to get a good rate.  Excellent value for money.  The rooms were quiet and of excellent quality together with the common areas of the hotel.  Great central location.  Reception service was a bit hit and miss.  Some of the staff are still feeling their way around the running of the hotel.We ate dinner (a la carte) and breakfast at the hotel.  The food was well cooked and of a good standard.  The service in the restaurant was disorganised and a lengthy ordeal at dinner.  Reading a previous review any dish containing mushrooms seems to be a problem as we ordered a menu dish containing mushrooms and it was delivered minus the mushrooms but also without any explanation or apology.  Our dessert choice (from the small number available) was ""out of stock"" however one of the waitresses did offer an apology and provided us access to the buffet desserts.  The mushrooms seem to be reserved for the breakfast buffet as there plenty on offer the following morning.The massage at the Spa was exceptionally good and well worth the extra effort we had to make to secure the booking.  Both therapists were very well trained and it was one of the best massages we have had in a very long time (massage connoisseurs).  The Spa was unattended so left the Front Reception to make the booking.  They failed to do this so we tried again later in the day and finally managed to make the booking.The rooms very much have that brand new feeling.  The bathrooms could do with a main door however were very spacious and luxurious in the King Deluxe room.The wireless service in the rooms is ""still to come"" however is available in the common areas for a fee.All in all was an enjoyable 5 star experience and we would stay there again.","Date of stay: December 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"5 star hotel but 3 star service delivery","Very disappointing. Allocated a room which had a shower drain that emitted a permanent sewage smell. Did report it but continued to smell. Overpriced drinks in skybar. Service from most reception staff was unfriendly and they spoke more to their colleagues whilst they were meant to be assisting us. Security/doormen were extremely friendly and helpful. Disappointed with Christmas lunch. Meat was tough. Supposed to have crackers but they were finished by 1.30pm! Did not offer black tea bags in room. When requested we received 2 bags for 3 people over the entire 3 days we spent there.  We also had to ask for a 3rd bath towel. Disappointed that the gift shop was closed over peak festive season. One of the lifts was faulty over the entire stay. Unlikely to recommend or visit again.","Date of stay: December 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Engagement Night","Visited the Hilton on my cousin's engagement and boy were we treated speacial. They had an Italian food buffet night, food was delicious and there was a wide variety of dishes. Could not eat much but had my fair share of the salads. We even got complimentary pizzas. The service however was somewhat flip flop, wrong drink orders, sometimes we had to search for the host. Service at the sky bar was much better and the staff more visible, oh ofcourse they were right infront of us;-).","Date of stay: June 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We had 2 rooms as they did not have any that slept 4 . Rooms are large and well appointed. Modern open plan bathroom with large soaker tub, separate shower and separated toilet. Room had tea and coffee facilities and a mini fridge. The staff were friendly the hotel well located. We had a lovely sunset cocktail on the roof deck where we had enjoyed an earlier embracing ( cool) swim in the pool. We had breakfast and it was a really good breakfast. Omelettes to order , French toast , pancakes , fruit , cereal,pastries, toast cold meat , bacon Etc.  I would definitely stay here again.","Date of stay: June 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good enough but not outstanding","We stayed here twice, one night at each end of our tour of Namibia.The allocated room was comfortable enough although the bathroom layout seemed most strange with bathroom itself open to the bedroom.  The shower unit within the open bathroom is enclosed with frosted glass as is the toilet except that, in the room we stayed the first night, the frosted glass door does not shut.  We had to use the litter bin to jam the door closed for some privacy.Otherwise the room is perfectly adequate and the beds are comfortable and with plenty of fluffy pillows.Reception staff at this hotel are polite and always helpful but doormen, concierge, porters are surly, unfriendly and seem to have no respect for the guests or belongings of the guests.  The greeter at the front door is not welcoming at all and seems to eye all comers with suspicion.  The portering staff appear to be always pushing for tips and if no tips are forthcoming are often rude and leave the luggage by the door or in one case actually throw items onto the floor.The breakfast here is very good with plenty of the usual choices.  The restaurant can be busy and somewhat crowded at the normal peak times but staff can be helpful when needed.","Date of stay: May 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great service, awesome location","The staff at the Hilton Hotel in Windhoek are all very friendly and helpful. They also have very good English skills and had no trouble understanding our American accents. Parking costs were very cheap. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was very enjoyable and had a good selection of food and drinks for everyone. We also highly enjoyed the sky bar on the roof where we could enjoy a nightcap and the beautiful sunset. The hotel is also in a great location on Independence Ave, making it easy to walk to restaurants, SlowTown Cafe, the Namibian Craft Centre, Christchurch, and St Mary's Cathedral - or flag down a taxi easily.","Date of stay: April 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great stay, excellent service","We had a lovely stay at the Hilton. Location is brilliant with easy access from the road to and from the parking area. Paying R60 per night for parking is a bit unnecessary as there were more than enough parking available. I feel that parking should be free, especially when paying for an executive suite. We had access to the executive lounge. Snacks during the day consisted of nuts, dried fruit and biltong. This should be reconsidered by the hotel by adding more variety. Staff is friendly and very helpful. Will definitely stay here again next time we are in Windhoek.","Date of stay: March 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hit and miss","Some aspects of this hotel were very good but, unfortunately, some were also rather poor. The rooms were comfortable with great air-con, and the breakfast was excellent. The pool area is very pleasant, gets the sun all day and the food is decent. The gym (just off the pool area) has a water cooler so you can help yourself to cold water. However, they allow non-residents to use the pool which meant that sometimes paying guest could not get a lounger. This was particularly bad on Christmas Day when non-residents took over completely and getting a space and/or any service at the bar was impossible. One of the main drawbacks for me was the staff, which were a mixed bag. Some were lovely, whilst others fell far short of what I would expect from the Hilton. One receptionist in particular, Zeroline, was very difficult to deal with and was actively hostile to us when we politely raised an issue with the wifi (which is so poor it is almost unusable). Criticism and client feedback is clearly not welcomed at this hotel. Every time we encountered her after that was very awkward and she really took the shine off the first few days of our trip. Reception/reservations would not telephone a local taxi and instead would only call the hotel taxi, which was up to three times the price of a local taxi.  We asked for assistance in booking an excursion with an external company and again they refused and said they would only assist if we used their taxi to take us on the excursion, which I thought was outrageous. The reason we were asking for help was because the wifi was so bad we could not book online. I would advise pre-booking any trips before you arrive. All in all, not a bad hotel but I would not return.","Date of stay: December 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The bathroom was interesting in that you couldn‚Äôt really close it off for privacy but if you‚Äôre with your loved one, it shouldn‚Äôt matter. We were in Namibia with a large group and dinner was family style in that we had a buffet with plenty of delicious options to choose from. Breakfast was also buffet and, again, the food was great.

"Good location, nice rooms, excellent restaurant","But perhaps best -- quiet!  There is construction going on next door, and we feared the worst when arriving. We asked for a quiet room, and were given one more-or-less in the middle of the hotel.  In the hall, you can hear the pounding of the pile-drivers.  Open the door, enter and close it... and you can hear nothing from outside at all. Very nice insulation.The location is within walking distance of many of the downtown tourist sites (church, artist market, etc). The rooms are nice, though a few touches seem to prefer ""form over function.""  None big enough to complain about though.","Date of stay: July 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappointing ","Hilton group are great, however I was disappointed with Windhoek Hilton. The staff are over relaxed. When a traveler walks in they normally uptight and had long journey behind them, then they paying the price for service as quick as possible , and this the staff must work on, react quickly not we coming back to you we coming back to you and then after 3 reminders still nothing. We arrived at 3 pm and the rooms were not ready, on asking they replied they coming back to us, at 4:45 pm I then had to threaten them that I want my money back and I‚Äôll move to another hotel only then 10 min I got my room, the reason I mention this is not that I would not wait for the room but if you tell me 2 hrs then I can plan around that maybe go out etc but every time you tell someone it will be ready soon you kind of wait and waist time. GIVE A PROPER ANSWER WITH A PROPER TIME. Please And fellow travelers how is this a Hilton and I have to pay parking and for Wi-Fi really. Other then that the food was excellent and the chef that walked around speaking to clients well done that is the way.","Date of stay: January 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Could do a lot vetter","Great service by the hotel staff is undermined by poorly designed rooms with potentially dangerous bathroom floors , poor internet, lifts and customer service. Don't even try to explain a problem , the management seem utterly incapable of trying to resolve anything. I've stayed extensively at both the Hilton and the Windhoek Country Club and the stark difference is the level of customer service you receive. The Hilton seems incapable of providing anything like a decent level of customer service. Perhaps they don't care as they know demand exceeds supply?","Date of stay: October 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Negatives: ""Fitness centre"" is just a couple cardio pieces, with one pulley machine and a few free weights. Internet is REALLY bad...good luck with it.

However, the service is quite strange. Emailed the hotel before my stay seeking assistance for airport transfer and received email after my stay offering a pickup.  Room service served two meals and two drinks but only one glass and one set of cutlery.  Concierge ran out of city maps and gave me a book with a sketched map in it for me to go for a jog.  Offered late checkout till noon but then had 3 different staff call my room between 1000 and 1200 to ask me when I expected to checkout.","Date of stay: June 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Accommodation and decor good, bad service spoiled my birthday","Room was lovely and clean and the bed wonderful. Shower lovely. Aircon a bit cold - one cannot control the temperature like with a normal aircon - most probably to save power ??, Switched it off and it was okay.  Would have liked the room warmer though.TV not so good - dark and the titles would not disappear like - just stayed there. Complained, they fixed it , but afterwards the same again. Reception gave good service and the porter was outstanding. Dinner was not so good - the food okay, but the service really bad. Waiter came to the table and then disappeared completely. Waited very long. Breakfast was a disaster. Table was not set properly, no coffee offered, had to ask over and over again. In the end they actually apologized by not letting our guests pay - ours was included - so we obviously paid. We warned them about it being my birthday the next morning, and they really tried to make it better. One should not make a scene and only then get service. Service at the Sky Bar was also VERY slow and waiter did not even clean the table before serving the wine.","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Business Trip to Windhoek","During May 2016 I visited Windhoek for Business.  I stayed in the Hilton Hotel Windhoek.  The reception on my arrival was great. Friendly, confident and skilled staff confirmed the booking and within minutes I arrived in my hotel room.The room is spacious, with a full bathroom with bath and shower.  Everything was neatly arranged and the room is well lit.  It accommodate Euro, British and South African wall electrical wall plugs.  I do like the fact that the Toilet is separate from the bathroom.  Luxury bath towels and a range of soaps, shampoos, shower caps etc. are supplied.  There is a small minibar fridge and it is well stocked.The suite I where in had a king size bed with a nice firm mattress ideal for someone like me with back issues.  The pillows and duvet are also of good quality and aid in a restful sleep.A buffet breakfast is available in the morning and what a spread of food.  I am sure that the breakfast buffet caters for almost all tastes and the service is excellent. There is a wide variety of restaurants on site and one almost don't need to go and hunt for good food and restaurants. If you like steak and fillet you will not be disappointed.  If you prefer fast food type food like hamburgers and pizza is also on the menu.  If it is a lite snack, a toasted sandwich or something sweet and decadent you will feel at home.  If you want to stay in the room there is a 24/7 room service available as well.  The gym facility, with spa and heated pool is a huge add-on.

"Poor internet","Recommended to me, I knew there were reviews on the poor internet and yes it is poor. Downloading and checking news and emails is fine, but I can't upload a document (not that big a file size) at all and no matter how many staff 'help' the problem remains I can't upload files I need to. Check in took a long time. The Executive rooms ( all that were available) are roomy and I haven't showered yet to try the pressure out. All I know is internet is important and it isn't working and there are other places where it works really well. There's off street parking and it is close to the city centre. I was slightly perturbed when told I would be unsafe walking around the city by checkin staff although I have been for days.","Date of stay: April 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Beautiful hotel with nightmarish customer service.","A modern, clean, beautiful property in downtown Windhoek. The moment you arrive you can tell it's a great place, but at the same time the nightmare regarding customer service starts. It begins at check in and never ends until you leave.","Date of stay: March 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappointed in Windhoek","this Hilton compared to others around the globe is marginal to average at best. The hotel, location and amenities are great--what is lacking is the ""can do"" attitude of the staff. So many mistakes from checkin and throughout my stay that all these small things ended up adding up. Noisy room, no recognition for loyalty, check out not complete and had to pay difference, etc..","Date of stay: February 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ms","The Hotel itself is very beautiful, it's the staff that I had an issue with. My mom, my sister and I came to the hotel for an early lunch at around 11:30. The lady at the Skybar had told us that they only start serving at 12:00 which we had no problem with and were willing to wait. When the time came to order, the waitress had a problem with taking my order. It was fairly simple, a club sandwich with no bread or mayo and a poached egg as opposed to fried. She literally made me repeat it three times and she said they could not give me a poached egg because the eggs are pre cooked, which by the way is very hazardous. Eventually she finally took our order, by then it was already 12:15, mind you we were already so hungry as we had skipped breakfast. It should not take 15 minutes to explain an order!! Then we waited another 30minutes for our drinks. I'm not sure how complicated a bottle of water could possibly be. When our food finally arrived at about 13:00 it was a total disaster. Firstly why did it take so long? The restaurant was not full!! The chicken fillet I got was probably boiled and tasted totally bland, the poached egg was rock hard even after I had especially  requested a soft one and there was no lettuce? My sisters ""Caesar salad had the same boring and tasteless chicken. I'm pretty sure the ""Caesar Dressing"" was mayo!! My moms Chorizo salad was dry, the chorizo was as hard as a rock and the portion sizes are way too big!! Ultimately it just a bad dining experience all around. We don't classify ourselves as difficult guests, but the staff need to be more attentive and accommodating. The service was really poor, I actually had to get up to ask for the bill? Hilton is a Worldwide brand and they have a certain standard that I have become accustomed to. I can't speak for other departments, but as far as Food and Beverage, you need some serious improvement. As a Hospitality graduate this my area of expertise. Management needs to train staff on improving customer service, guest relations and service excellence? You are running a risk of not having return customers, people take their food seriously.","Date of stay: February 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good for Business","I spent 10 days at the Hilton Windhoek during my last visit to Namibia. Overall it is a good hotel for a business traveller. The staff is attentive and courteous. The breakfast is sufficiently varied that you can go 7+ days before being bored with the menu. The fitness centre is great with fantastic views over the city.","Date of stay: February 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Luxury in Windhoek","An upscale hotel within walking distance of Windhoek's main thoroughfare, Independence Avenue.  There is a pool on the top floor and a Sky Bar overlooking Windhoek; there is a restaurant and a sushi bar on the M level.  The room is very modern, and the bathroom is quite posh with soft side lighting.  The overhead showerhead makes showering always more pleasant.  One thing missing, though, was a safe.  Overall, Hilton Windhoek offers a luxurious stay.","Date of stay: January 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comfortable business hotel","When I travel for business I want a comfortable bed, a functional work area and stable, fast wi-fi. Hilton gave me all that, the basics, but nothing more. The restaurant staff was friendly, the house keeping staff great, and I should also add that my room was kept spotlessly clean throughout my stay. Breakfast was very good, with lots of options. I had dinner in the hotel a couple of times and I was less impressed with the dinner buffet offerings. Location was perfect since my meetings were all in the center of Windhoek, and I could walk.","Date of stay: November 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The pool deck offers good views of the city and is a comfortable place to hang out and have drinks after work.  The breakfasts are good and varied.

"Modernes und zentral gelegenes Hotel in der Hauptstadt von Namibia","Das Hotel ist sehr modern und grossz√ºgig eingerichtet. Die Zimmer sind sehr gross, hell und mit sch√∂nem Bad ausgestattet. Was dann aber erstaunt ist dass man nur in der Lobby oder der n√§heren Umgebung Gratis Wi-Fi bekommen kann. In den Zimmern muss man daf√ºr bezahlen. Das Personal an der Reception und im Restaurant ist hilfsbereit und freundlich. Was man aber dann vom Personal an der Kaffeebar bei der Lobby und vor allem in der Skybar nicht behaupten kann. Ich war als einziger Gast am Sonntagnachmittag ca. um 16.00 Uhr an der Kaffeebar. Die Serviertochter stand hinter der Theke und machte w√§hrend 10 Minuten keine Anstalten mich zu bedienen. Genau das Gleiche passierte etwas sp√§ter auf der Skybar. 5 Personen waren hinter oder vor der Bar im Einsatz. Etwa 15 G√§ste waren am Pool oder an der Bar. Ich wurde aber w√§hrend 15 Minuten nicht bedient. Am Ende holte ich mir dann selber einen Drink an der Bar. So etwas darf in einem Hotel wie Hilton einfach nicht passieren. Der Service war entt√§uschend.","Date of stay: August 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Der Name verspricht mehr als die Wirklichkeit","Wer ein 5-Sterne-Hotel bucht, erwartet auch einen 5-Sterne-Service. Aber da ist das Hilton in Windhoek meilenweit von entfernt. Habe mit meiner Frau 6 Tage in diesem Hotel gewohnt und von dort diverese Aktivit√§ten gestartet.Das gleich nebenan befindliche 4-Sterne-Hotel ""Kalahari-Sands"", in welchem wir 2 Jahre zuvor gewohnt hatten, hat eine andere Qualit√§t.Das Hilton ist ab dem Eingang schon unpers√∂nlich und steril, - hat keinen Flair. Die Keycard f√ºr den Lift funktioniert permament nicht richtig und muss st√§ndig neu codiert werden. Die Zimmer entsprechen dem Standard in dieser Klasse, auch der Zimmerservice. WLAN muss teuer bezahlt werden - ein absolutes NoGo! Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffett ist alles nur keine 5 Sterne wert. Der Service und insbesondere die Schnelligkeit lassen auch hier zu w√ºnschen √ºbrig. Die Skybar wurde mehrfach schon um 23 Uhr geschlossen, da angeblich keine Getr√§nke mehr vorhanden, die Bar, eine Etage tiefer, hatte volle K√ºhlschr√§nke.An einem Tag ben√∂tigten wir, da wir sehr fr√ºh zu einer Tour starteten, ein Lunchpaket. Aber was wir da bekommen haben, kann man nur als Frechheit bezeichnen, zwei trockene Sandwich-Dreiecke, mit K√§se und Tomate belegt, einen Apfel und einen Trink-Yoghurt.Mein Fazit: F√ºr weniger Geld gibt es in direkter Nachbarschaft bessere Hotels. Sogar das ""Safari-Court-Hotel"", leider nicht zentral gelegen aber mit kostenlosem Shuttleservice, ist besser.","Date of stay: January 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Breakfast was all our hearts could desire after 3 weeks traveling not once tasting our own kind of food. The massages were relaxing and quickly worked out the knots from the long flights, leaving us rested and ready (though reluctantly) returning home to real life. It was the perfect ending to our honeymoon.","Date of stay: October 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Allerdings zeigen Bad und Zimmer bereits einige Gebrauchsspuren, was bei einem 5Sterne Hotel, welches erst seit zwei Jahren existiert nicht sein d√ºrfte. Europ√§ische Steckdosen sind vorhanden. Internet ebenfalls, aber gegen Geb√ºhr.Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist, wie ich es von Hilton gewohnt bin, umfangreich und reichhaltig. Man merkt aber auch hier die afrikanische L√§ssigkeit.

Leider wird neben dem Hotel gerade gebaut. Der L√§rm st√∂rt nicht, aber die Baustelle verschandelt etwas die Aussicht. Zur Sundowner-Zeit ist das Personal an der Skybar auch etwas √ºberfordert.

"Good location to view the sights","We stayed at the Hilton for 1 night at the end of our trip around Namibia. This is a sparkling, modern hotel that is well placed in the center of Windhoek. We arrived a little dusty after a long drive from Sesriem but check-in was quick and we were given a room even before the 2pm check-in time. The room was large and spacious, very modern and well equipped, complete with large flat screen tv and views across the city. The beds were large and very comfortable. I was very impressed with the bathroom that had a separate shower and bath tub. We ate lunch in the cafe near the reception and they had a good selection of foods. Breakfast the next morning was a grand affair, with an enormous amount of choice and lots of fresh and tasty foods. However, the skybar on the roof top was the most memorable experience. We had sun downers there (of good value) while watching the sun set over our Namibian adventure. I highly recommend the Hilton for a stay in Windhoek as all of the city's sights are in walking distance.","Date of stay: May 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Wonderful start to our Namibia trip","We had two nights here in January and it was a great chance to relax before we went off on 2 weeks safari around Namibia. I will always be biased about this place, as my boyfriend proposed to me as soon as we arrived! So if there were any negatives about this place, I really didn't notice them. Our room was wonderful - bed comfortable, great shower, quiet, well stocked. The rooftop pool area was a brilliant place to chill the day away reading a book. Food was great - we had the full buffet breakfast each morning, and steak dinner on our second night - service was good. I would recommend this as a great place to start or finish a safari, as I don't believe there was much to do in the city itself - though we didn't venture exploring at all..","Date of stay: January 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice hotel but noisy","Stayed a few days in this nice new hotel. The staff were friendly but u able to help when there was a problem. Our room was very noisy due to the water system but the staff continually ignored the request for a different room.Internet is very slow and far too expensive.","Date of stay: December 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Mr","The overall experience was great with exception of the bar in which the beers were hot and no stock of one of the most drank brads of beer. I would stay there again as it is good value for money.

"Muy bueno, pero...","Muy buenas las habitaciones, con todas las comodidades como no pod√≠a ser de otra manera para un Hilton, la atenci√≥n es buena y dedicada.La tarifa con desayuno tiene una importante diferencia con la que no lo incluye; el Wi-Fi en la habitaci√≥n es llamativamente caro.-Tiene una muy buena ubicaci√≥n y excelente vista de la ciudad.-","Date of stay: February 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great start to Namibia","Our party of 19 stayed here at the beginning of our 11 days in Namibia.  The rooms are comfortable, the service is good and the breakfast is great.  A particular highlight is the roof top bar and pool, especially good at sunset.  Highly recommended.","Date of stay: September 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"WINDHOEK HILTON--I NICE PLACE TO STAY","I stayed at the Windhoek, Namibia Hilton twice in August 2013. Both visits were great. The best thing about the visit was the staff--they are responsive, respectful and nice.

"Good Hotel, excellent view, modern rooms","Stayed on business, excellent room, clean, modern and great bathroom. Decor great. Check in had my laughing as they gave me the keys to a room someone was staying in, a lady, and I walked into the room to both our surprise, went down stairs and there was some embarrassed and confused faces, all got sorted out and I was up an running for the stay. Food was good and good selection for breakfast and a special order of eggs was done for me with little fan fare. Bar service was slow in the evening even though bar was not to full, we put it down to Namibia lifestyle, everything happens slowly, is the only negative that comes to mind. Would stay here again best hotel in Windhoek.","Date of stay: June 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good Hotel but.......","I was in Namibia from the 01st July - 04th July 2013 on business.There was about 10 of us and we decided to stay at the Hilton as its close to our officesCheck in was easy and straight forward, the only disappointment was that we checked in at 1545 hrs and some of the rooms were not ready therefore we proceeded to office without refreshing. Another member of our party quipped sarcastically that they expected a welcome drink from a 5 star.. ouchOnce checked in and settled the rooms were great,  clean and very spacious. They more than made up for the late check in procedure. I went to the gym three times and though small it was never full, I always had access to any equipment that I wanted. I was out most of the time and only had breakfast at teh hotel. The breakfast was excellent with a good variety of cereals, fruits and hot food (eggsThe skybar is the highlight of the hotel after a long day at the office and should not be missed. Nothing beats sipping a drink looking at the beautiful undulating Windhoek skyline Lastly and sadly being a business hotel its very disappointing that Internet access is charged separately and exorbitantly. To pay +/- US$200 per night for accommodation and get charged +/- US$20 for every 24 hours for internet access is ridiculous. To make it worse its US$20 per gadget, if you want access on the laptop and ipad you pay twice. The internet access issue is such a sore point for me that I will consider twice next time before staying there especially if am in Windhoek on business.","Date of stay: July 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Fantastic stay in Windhoek!!!","I visit Windhoek often for business purposes and usually stay at the Windhoek Country Club. I decided to try out the newly build Hilton Hotel in Windhoek during my last trip to the country and I was absolutely impressed with the design and feel of the hotel. It is, in my opinion, the only hotel worthy of a 5 star rating in WIndhoek - it really is a world-class establishment. Friendly staff, fantastic food. Definitely no better alternative in Windhoek.","Date of stay: July 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Business or backpacker?","I recently stayed at the Hilton in Windhoek with a group of 15 frequent travelers. Some were lucky enough to stay on the side of the hotel without the all night disco for our fri and sat night stays - I was not. I was placed in the room closest to housekeeping and the nightclub with the stairwell / rubbish door open. No need to say much more, although I was glad they closed the door next night of my two night stay, after asking.Why a business hotel would decide to have an all night disco running in their hotel seems like a poor decision to me.I would have turned a blind eye and thought ""oh well"" but for the fact it took us several attempts to get some towels in our room. When they finally came they were dumped on the bed like a pile of dirty clothes, unfolded and looking like the towels to wipe the floor. We asked for others but never got any. Accommodation and service in Namibia is very very good and perhaps this just showed up the flaws at the Hilton.","Date of stay: May 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"No so good first experience","I wanted the ""Hilton"" experience in Africa :), all i ended up was being left stranded at the airport, with miillions of men wanting to drive me to town for a reasonable price, not feeling secure at all. Upon arrival i was billed by the taxi that never showed up :( ...after one night in the hotel i decided to leave and check in into a B&B where i was treated like 5 stars!","Date of stay: May 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hilton tops in Windhoek","Great hotel, great service, great staff! What a beautiful hotel and a great country. I never thought of putting Namibia on my list of countries but I am glad I did. The only recommendation I'd make to the staff is that everyone including the security outside need to know about the city...I asked many employees about certain sites and they had no idea... Other than that it's a great hotel and Namibia is one of the better countries of Africa!","Date of stay: March 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"AMAZING Service!","I visited the Hilton in Windhoek twice while I was in Namibia. I was very suprised by the amazingly helpful service. I was a lone 21 year old, visiting Africa for the first time, So I was nervous to be traveling alone.However at my stay they made me feel very safe and anything I needed they gave me instantly!They also were very quick in organising my taxi to the airport.The room was lovely, very clean and great for my 2 nights stay!Would definately recommend to any travellers all over!","Date of stay: December 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Slow service, great views","We had 2 separate visits of 2 nights, a week apart.  Spent quite a bit of time in the bar on the mezzanine - the one on the roof is pretty spectacular for views but usually very windy.  Service in the bar was always friendly but with only one exception (thanks Elrico), very slow indeed.  Restaurant was OK and bar food quite good.  Concierge very helpful and efficient.  Kettle with tea and instant coffee in room.  Did not have breakfast or use the spa.I don't understand why 5* international hotels persist in charging for internet access.  This is ridiculous in today's world and always leaves a bad taste.  It's a bit like charging extortionate minibar charges - why not just add a bit more onto the room charge and give 'free' access, making everybody much happier?","Date of stay: October 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very good experience","We had a very good experience at the Hilton Windhoek.  We spent 2 weeks in Namibia to see the country, visit friends, and see the animals.  We spent our first night and last night in Namibia here at the Hilton.  As a frequent Hilton guest, they provided excellent service to us (2 couples, 1- 50ish, and the other in their 80s).  Everything was so shinny and clean, it was obvious the hotel was pretty new.  We got lucky at the airport, and when we called, it turned out that their driver was already there, so the return trip was very fast.  We never ate in the restaurant, so I can't comment on that; but, we did visit the lounge on the top floor (which was very nice), and they addressed us by name.  I‚Äôd have to say, this Hilton beats the ones I‚Äôve stayed at in the USA for its rooms and its service.After being out and about in the country at smaller places, the Hilton was incredibly luxurious by comparison.","Date of stay: May 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"No Complaints","I stayed two nights by myself at the end of October and can truly say I have no complaints at all!Service was fast and I had assistance bringing my bags to my room. I stayed in a basic suite but still found it stunning. For my first night supper was great I got the oven baked pizza with baked strawberry cheesecake for dessert. the 2nd night had the buffet which was plentiful and delicious. The waitresses were great and came back frequently to refill drinks/ask how my food was. Breakfast was my favorite by far with many choices, and once again excellent staff. I needed internet and the front desk immediately found me a computer and got me hooked up. Also were able to tell me some good shops around and give me some helpful tips.All in all stunning place and I would stay again in a heartbeat!","Date of stay: October 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Best Hotel in Namibia","If you are looking for somewhere luxurious and comfortable to be spoilt Hilton Windhoek is the perfect choice when in Namibia. This new hotel with its stunning rooms and the wonderful staff make this one of the most memorable stays of our African trip.  We would not hesitate to recommend Hilton Windhoek for its great comfort and care.","Date of stay: July 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not that impressive","On holiday with my family and stayed overnight in the Hilton Windhoek. I do travel a lot and is used to the best hotels in the world, this one was pretty disappointing.The Hilton is luxurious (as you would expect) with a friendly staff and good clean accommodation. This is were is ends. The heated pool was was cold (heat pump broke). We were allocated a room with an inter-leading door for the children. The children's room was not ready at the time of check-in so we initially unpacked our luggage in the 1 room. After numerous phone calls to reception (without response), eventually we were told we had to move to a different room all together. This is after we unpacked! I was not happy. We ordered Mojitos but they did not have mint leaves!We had dinner in the hotel restaurant and waited for our food for more than an hour and they got the whole order wrong!! The next morning we had breakfast in the same restaurant. On arrival the buffet area was empty with no sausages, eggs, bacon etc etc etc. I made a fuss and after 15 min this was stocked up again. I ordered a omelet, this never arrived. The whole experience was pretty disappointing and not what you expect from a Hilton hotel. I'm not convinced I will go there again.","Date of stay: June 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
