"Good hotel, friendly staff","I stayed here at the start of my Namibia safari and on the last day of my tour.  It's located outside the city centre but they have a free shuttle service which operates every 30 mins, taking people to and from the centre.  I found this very useful.  To get to the hotel from the airport I got one of those minivans - 100 NAM dollars. The room that I stayed in on the first night was very very big - 2 double beds and a sofa bed.  The decor is a bit dated and the carpet looks old, but I didn't feel uncomfortable there.  The bathroom was also a bit dated and the light bulb in there kept flashing when I turned it on.  The room I stayed in on my last night in Namibia was a bit smaller but again, it was comfortable.The hotel has several restaurants.  I had a buffet dinner at the Welwitschia restaurant on the first night.  Good selection of food.  The buffet breakfast, which is included, had a fine selection of cereals and hot meals - the crepes were excellent!  On my last night there I tried their Grill Room and had an excellent calamari steak.I would highly recommend this hotel as a place to start/end your adventure in Namibia.  The staff are friendly and the services are excellent.","Date of stay: August 2005This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not willing to take any responsibility!","My wife and I as well as my mother were guests in your hotel on our final night of our annual Namibia holiday in rooms 59 and 60 from November 9th toNovember 10th 2012..This being our final night I enquired at the safari hotel reception about the possibility of a shuttle to the airport the next day as well as the exact time of departure of the SAA noon flight. According to schedule shown to me my Sergio the departure time of this flight was 1.20 PM. As I had in the back of my mind the departure time of 12:20 PM I went to the safari court reception to use the business center and check the departure time again online on our flight schedule. This  again said 12:20 PM. With this information I approached the Safari Court reception which again told me the flight would leave at 1:20 PM. This was confirmed by an elderly old white gentleman with reddish white hair working for the safari hotels, as he overheard my conversation with the reception. He explained the difference in time due to the change from summer time to winter time in Germany. This seemed plausible to me, as he said that he has returned from Germany last week and had had a similar experience. Furthermore he laughed when I jokingly said, I would sue him, if he was wrong.Unfortunately when the three of us arrived at Windhuk  Airport at 11.55 AM we had to find out, that the SAA Flight did indeed leave at 12:20 PM and the gates were already closed and the machine was on the runway. Not even my star alliance gold status was able to change anything as the machine was overbooked. I therefore had to buy three additional British airways tickets so that we luckily were still able to catch our flight from Johannesburg to Germany.From the airport I called Sergio as well as Francis of your staff to complain about this misinformation of Safari Hotels which cost me over ND 6.000,00. They both once again confirmed that according to their schedule the flight time should have been 1:20 PM and were shocked that this was not correct. Francis agreed with me that on behalf of Safari Hotels it was luck that only the three of us were affected and that we were able to get seats on the BA flight. The disaster could have been much bigger, if a larger group was effected or/ and if the intercontinental flights would have been missed.As safari hotels was recommended to me as a hotel of high international standard and the service and quality we experienced during our stay only confirmed this, there was no reason for me to have any doubts about the information I received from both receptions. All above is cited trom the letter I sent them. The only reaction I got was: This is all your own (my) problem, we are not responsible at all, not even on a goodwill basis!Wonder how other hotels of international reputation would have reacted!","Date of stay: November 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Struttura datata","Struttura datata comoda logisticamente per iniziare o finire un viaggio in Namibia ma non di certo per soggiornarci.Stanze spaziose, bagni ok servizio clienti meno. Siamo rimasti senza coperte in inverno perché nessuno riusciva a trovare le house keeping, per rendere l’idea...","Date of stay: August 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappointing","We needed a last minute place to stay, so I booked the hotel on hotels.com the day before we arrived.  When we arrived at the hotel, they couldn't find our reservations.  I provided them with my booking confirmation details, showed them the email I received, and it still took almost an hour before they gave us a room.  They were friendly and nice about it, just not very helpful.Claiming to have received an ""upgrade"" due to the inconvenience, we were given a really dated room with a very lackluster bathroom, and in addition, the wifi didn't work.  The bed was uncomfortable with very unprofessional ink stamps of the hotel's logo on the bedding.  On the plus side, there was free breakfast (poor service) that was quite yummy and free parking. Overall, there are definitely better places to stay for a similar price.  I will not be returning and I do not recommend this place to fellow travellers.","Date of stay: March 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very Disappointing stay!","Hotel standards very disappointing. We stayed here for 3nights and simply could not wait to leave. The hotel reception lady we found at check in was very unpleasant and simply did not know anything from room rates to asking us to come back after an hour or two and you can just imagine that we had been driving for two whole days to get to windhoek only to find such incompetency at a very well established hotel which we had once stayed in back in 2018 and the service then was just fine. Long story short, we got interleading rooms to accommodate our family (3 children and two adults). Upon check in, the wrong room had been made up and wrong keys given to us (no surprise there as the front lady staff we found was just in another world) and the rooms were not properly cleaned. Beds made but the cleaning standards close to zero! The restaurant staff very friendly and professional especially Justina, chef also excellent but in dining service very pathetic in that it took ages for food to arrive even despite the assurance that it would arrive within 30mins on all days. Another long story short, this hotel has a sewer stench in many places on the property. Outside, inside and this was very odd! Finally, how do you have one side of hotel fully operational and where guests are sleeping, it's totally deserted with a security guard being the only person to provide service and a note at reception saying ""call this number if you need service!"" I was very disappointed with our stay and we have had to find alternative accommodation elsewhere. Very disappointing for such a high standard hotel. Goodness. Please re-train them front office staff esp the lady we found upon check in and let staff be professional to all guests whether white or black. We definitely felt the nonsense segregation and treatment. Not worth our hard earned cash to waste here at all!","Date of stay: November 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hotel confortable","Un bon hôtel pour finir son périple ou le commencer après un long vol. Les chambres sont spacieuses au charme un peu désuet. La salle de bain est un peu petite et rudimentaire. La restauration est bonne et les prix sont correctes. L'hôtel est excentré de la ville mais il possède une navette gratuite pour s'y rendre.

"Service","Hi thereI stayed at the hotel in room 1037. Both days I was there there were no hot water. Not one of the managers had the decency to tell me or the other guests. They left it up to the reception guys. After complaining again to the reception they moved me to room 132 in the business rooms. I checked out this morning and still no apology. I stay at this hotel because of the service and friendly staff. Managers excluded. Will I stay there with my next visit in a month's time. I will have to think about that.Very disappointed Alex Gray","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Dated rooms, good breakfast, rooms too hot","I stayed here during an over landing trip of Africa. The rooms were spacious but dated, the shower was powerful and had a good temperature but the room was just boiling. The outside was swarming with mosquitoes so we were unable to leave windows etc open and the fan did nothing for the heat, unbearable heat, so a bad nights sleep. We also couldn't get the wifi in our room so had to walk towards the lobby when most of our friends could receive signal in their rooms. Bar staff friendly but a long time to be served a drink and reception staff could have been more friendly but overall a decent hotel, I just wouldn't stay again.","Date of stay: November 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Large rooms, great breakfast!","Stayed here for one night before an overland tour departing for Botswana.Rooms: well-maintained, similar to any standard western hotel room. Showers were hot and well-pressurized. Complimentary wifi was available. Services: gym, pool and other amenities were all very nice relative to other places I've stayed in Africa. Breakfast is delicious and served daily buffet-style from 6am. It consisted of fruits, cereal, eggs, sausage, bacon, beans, sweet breads, toast, omelette bar, and coffee/tea. Delicious!I would consider recommending this hotel for those looking for a western hotel to stay in as it does not have any African uniqueness.","Date of stay: September 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Adequate, just","My room was clean. The twin beds were rather small but i was able to push them together to have more space. The furniture was rather shabby and outdated. The water in the bathroom came out a rusty colour but i was told it was due to a broken pipe which was about to be repaired. Breakfast was poor - definitely below standard.","Date of stay: December 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Old Prison?","We spend one night in this hotel, as we booked via a tour operator we probably got a budget room that reminded us of a military or prison complex. Worked for the night, but not something we would have wanted to stay longer. The hotel facilities were very good though, the restaurant and bar up to standard. I think maybe the rooms in the main building will have a better feel, we were in the last building away in ""the barracks"". Water was warm, room clean and we slept well.","Date of stay: July 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Like walking into a 1950's rec room","The one good thing about this hotel that it is walking distance to the airport and you pass right by a car hire; important since the counters at the airport never seem to be open.  However, the hotel is old and tired.  It is quite large, with several 3 story buildings, no elevator, and lots of parking.  The rooms are huge with that cheap wood panelling and spindly legged furniture from a 1950's basement rec room.  Two double beds, complete with dust bunnys beneath, and a pullout make it an ideal location if you have a couple of rambunctious kids.  No possibility of them ever ruining anything here.  The bathrooms aren't great and because there's only a shower, there's no place to hang up hand washing.  (I saw wet socks hanging out of windows.) The restaurant has a large but monotenous buffet although you can walk to the nicer hotel on the grounds for a slightly better meal.","Date of stay: March 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Tired hotel, poor food and uncomfortable beds","I would not recommend this hotel at all. Luckily only stayed one night, but it was very uncomfortable. The shower barely worked, drains were blocked and I struggled to get the warm tap even open. The hotel did not feel clean at all and the beds are rock hard. The staff is friendly and helpful, but the hotel will never see me again. We had dinner at the hotel and expected to have a great steak, but they managed to serve the worse fillet I have ever tasted.

"Mediocre, if not sub-par","Preface: This 3-star Safari Hotel is located adjacent to its more modern 4-star sister Safari Court as well as the Safari Conference Centre, all within a fenced compound. So bear in mind that this review is only meant for the 3-star motel and not the others. First Impressions: Having spent the better of two weeks camping, I was ready for any place that had concrete instead of dirt under my feet. Imagine my pleasant surprise upon entering the lobby of Hotel Safari. Marbled floors, elegant decor, rich fabric. Quite classy, I thought. And then, imagine my utter disappointment when we were told to personally carry our luggage 50 meters away to the group of rooms set up like a 1950's drive-in strip motel. Yeah, that feeling. Apparently, our tour operator booked us into the standard budget rooms for one night.Pros: For the business types, the conference centre is just next door. There is free airport shuttle, free WiFi, swimming pool, complimentary breakfast at its on-site restaurant and a souvenir shop. For extended internet use, one may ask to use the handful of computer terminals over at the Safari Court's business centre. Overall, service is friendly, courteous and helpful.Cons: Unfortunately, every positive feature of this motel has its letdowns. Location is not its best asset. It is quite far from the Windhoek city centre as well as the international airport. Although free shuttle is available, it is only to the nearby domestic airport and only until 6pm. Our rooms, though clean, appear dated and tired. The free WiFi is restricted to 2 hours and different passwords are handed out on slips of paper.  (I went around this restriction by collecting several access passwords until I had a bunch.) The pool can get quite cold!!! The souvenir shop is small and has limited inventory. The breakfast is forgettable. Verdict: This hotel has the potential to be a very nice one, if only management had bothered to upgrade, if not refurbish, it. I'm not a fussy traveller but, if you only use the hotel to sleep in, it does the job. Just lower your expectations. It is adequate for a few day's stay but, for longer stays, there are better accommodations closer to the city centre.","Date of stay: September 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comodo","L'Hotel si trova fuori dal centro, vicino al vecchio aeroporto, è comodo da raggiungere e se si è sprovvisti d'auto, le navette dell'albergo portano praticamente ovunque. E' stato il nostro punto di partenza, l'unico albergo della nostra esperienza namibiana. Le stanze hanno arredi un pò datati, ma sono grandi, estremamente spaziose, pulite e comode quelle a pian terreno ""tipo motel"".Insomma niente di trascendentale, ma funzionale all'uso.","Date of stay: August 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Der absoulte Top Urlaub","Das Camp ist hervorragend, die achteckigen Zelte sind bestens ausgestattet. Hier gibt es einen fest gemauerten Waschtisch und gemauerte und getrennte DU und WC. Steckdosen, Schreibtisch, Moskitonetz, Terasse mit 2 Stühlen und Öllampe. Im Zelt gibt es eine Taschenlampe (da ab ca. 23. 00 Uhr-05. 00 Uhr kein Strom!) und eine Trillerpfeife für Notfälle. Außerdem gibt es einen Klingelknopf, damit man bei Dunkelheit und für Gepäckservice einen Massai rufen kann, dieser bringt die Gäste sicher zum Hauptgebäude. Das Camp ist unter deutscher Leitung, der Service ist super. Das Restaurant bot abends ein 4Gang Wahlmenue von sehr guter Qualität, das Frühstücksbuffet war umfangreich und ebenfalls sehr gut. Es gibt auch richtige Zimmer in Bungalows und neuerdings einen Pool mit Wellnessbereich. All dies ist direkt in der Wildnis (Steppe), ohne Zaun direkt neben den Warzenschweinen, Impalas und Erdhörnchen.","This review is the subjective opinion of an individual traveler and not of Tripadvisor LLC nor of its partners.

"Excellent Mid-Market Choice ~ Especially Business Rooms","The service at reception was smooth and efficient, if a little abrupt. The main Lobby was modern and smart, with seating both inside and outside reception and a small hotel gift shop.We booked a 'Business' room which was only marginally more expensive than the Standard room rate. It was situated on the first floor of a block adjoining (opposite) the main building that housed reception. The room was brand new, having only recently undergone complete refurbishment, was large and fitted to a high quality. Superb bathroom with all new fittings, shower and large accomodating bath. Tea & Coffee making facilities, Fridge/Mini-Bar, satellite TV, individually controlled Air- Conditioning (a little noisy).The hotel had three main restaurants and several bars. We ate in the main a la carte restaurant (which also offered a buffet choice) and although the service was a little slow, the staff were friendly, courteous and the food & wine was excellent ~ and reasonable, Namibian prices! The buffet breakfast also offered a wide range (our room rate was inclusive of breakfast). We stayed only one night for a post-Safari stop, before departing for the UK. We used the Swimming Pool and Beer Garden bar which were well organised. The main road passes the hotel quite near to the swimming pool, but road noise was never a problem.You can also use the facilities of the sister hotel ~ the Hotel Safari Court (4*) , which is within the same grounds ~ although we never had time to try these and the hotel also runs a free mini-bus service into the centre of Windhoek, approx. 8-10 mins away which was efficiently run. We could thoroughly recommend this excellent 3* property and would suggest the small extra for the refurbished 'Business' rooms is worth paying.","Date of stay: October 2006This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"OK if you want average","I guess this place is more geared for accommodating groups for conferences.  The conference venue is reasonable.  The accommodation facilities were reasonable, the same for catering.  Hotel staff was average, not falling over their feet to render good service.  For conferences,  business meetings,  business accommodation this is a reasonable venue.  Not sure that I will stay here as a tourist - will probably rather find a guest house or something else instead.","Date of stay: March 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Guter Service","Wir waren zu Beginn unserer Namibia Rundreise die erste Nacht im Safari und dann wieder am letzten Tag vor dem Rückflug noch eine Nacht. Der Empfang war herzlich, ein Willkommens Drink wurde serviert. Das WLan war kostenlos. Eine europäische Steckdose war im Zimmer vorhaben, so das kein Adapter notwendig war.Insgesamt ein gutes Hotel für den Einstieg in eine Rundreise.","Date of stay: May 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Mind-blowingly rubbish","Dirty, old and crumbling hotel. Pretty disgusting rooms and decor reminiscent of a 70's old peoples home. Rude staff that were generally very unhelpful - plenty of them walking around but none of them doing anything.. Oh no wait they're busy have a play fight with each other, so that's why there's no service. Ordering a sandwich took an hour and a half and when it eventually arrived may well have been made with last weeks leftovers.CONSTRUCTION work starts at 7.30am in the room above you which is very relaxing, especially if you enjoy hammer drills and angle grinders.The Internet.. The most infuriating internet connection you'll probably ever come across. Requires an id and password a thousand letters long and needs re-entering every time you go back to using your phone or laptop. Mind-blowingly fun. There's just no need for it to be like that which makes it all the more infuriating.Was very happy to leave!","Date of stay: May 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comodo per l'aeroporto","E' un albergo gigantesco situato a circa 4 km dal mercato dell'artigianato africano. Non è brutto, ma molto datato e anche trasandato.

"UNA BUONA BASE","Ho trascorso due notti all'inizio ed alla fine del nostro tour in Namibia presso questo hotel che mi è parso buono e con un ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo.So bene che in Namibia esistono hotel e lodge di qualità elevata, ma questa struttura ha tutto quello che può servire ad un viaggiatore che bada alla sostanza.L'hotel è costituito da due strutture, una di categoria 3* ed una di categoria 4*.Noi abbiamo alloggiato nel 3 stelle e questo il mio giudizio:la hall è molto accogliente con personale gentile e disponibileLe camere sono molto grandi, con arredamento un pò datato ma funzionale e sono dotate di aria condizionata, bollitore per tè e caffè e televisore (senza canali italiani).I bagni sono buoni e puliti. Le camere sono sistemate in bungalow tutti a piano terra e se avete l'auto la potete parcheggiare proprio davanti alla porta d'ingresso.Per la cena, si hanno a disposizione due ristoranti: quello del 4* stelle ha un ottimo buffet a prezzo fisso (circa 20 Euro con bevande) con carne, pesce e antipasti a volontà. Il 3* stelle ha un buffet altrettanto valido ma un pò meno ricco.L'hotel è abbastanza distante dal centro, anche se è collegato con una navetta gratuita con numerose corse durante il giorno.Dispone anche di una bella piscina, anche se non molto grande, ma molto ben ambientata con prato e lettini prendisole.Considerato che comunque a Windhoek non si deve dedicare oltre due notti la sistemazione è più che valida","Date of stay: August 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Much to be improved","The Safari Hotel is not an expensive hotel, but it is dreary and much in need of freshening up. For the sentimental, it does offer many flashback's to the 70s with plenty of brown and orange decor and even a headboard mounted radio with preprogrammed dial for changing stations. Receptionists are lacking in enthusiasm and once you have your room key – attached to a super-sized fob – it's across the busy roadway to your likely distant room. With no obvious pedestrian crossing marked across the road, and not much evidence of speed regulation within the hotel precinct, you will not get to your accommodation feeling relaxed. The sheets were clean and the bed comfortable, and the room large enough not to feel cramped. Floor space economized upon in the bathroom, where there is minimal space to move between the shower, basin and toilet. Showering also requires quite a bit of maneuvering as the worn shower head is very much multidirectional. In general, meals in Namibia are good to excellent, but dinner at the nearby Safari Court – ostrich stroganoff – was expensive and poorly prepared. Try your luck with a careful selection at the buffet instead. Breakfast the Safari Hotel was pretty average - oily frying area to be avoided, and no choice of some basics like skim milk to go with the cereals. Anyhow, it wouldn't take more than some good advice and some serious commitment to improve on the experience.","Date of stay: September 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Clean & Comfortable","Safari hotel is the 3 star sister hotel of the Safari Court Hotel. The hotel is old, and the rooms are in need of an upgrade; but it was clean and comfortable for our requirements. The breakfast was a good old classic full buffet; the coffee was delicious and the service was fantastic. The staff are very friendly and efficient. we had a blocked drain in the room, and it was fixed immediately. The facilities at the hotel are great; and the property is very secure.","Date of stay: April 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nicht unbedingt empfehlenswert","Das Safari Hotel liegt am südlichen Stadtrand von Windhuk, in deutlicher Sicht- und Hörweite des Flughafens Eros. Das erste uns zugewiesene Zimmer haben wir direkt zurückgegeben, weil es so unglaublich dreckig war, auf dem Tablett mit den Kaffee- und Teezubereitungsmöglichkeiten befand sich benutztes Geschirr. So etwas geht gar nicht und zeigt, wie schlampig das Housekeeping in diesem Hotel ist. Generell war das Personal dort sehr unfreundlich (bis auf die Rezeptionisten) und grüßte die Gäste prinzipiell nicht, ebenfalls ein absolutes No-Go. Das zweite uns zugewiesene Zimmer war dann auch nicht besser: ein verschlissenes Sofa, auf dem sich noch eingetrocknete Käse- und Brötchenkrümel der Vorgänger befanden, aber wenigstens - zumindest optisch - saubere Tassen. Die abgewohnten Buche-Furnier-Sperrholzmöbel und die löchrige, befleckte Tagesdecke auf dem Bett trug auch nicht gerade zur Verbesserung des Gesamteindrucks bei. Die Zimmertür war leider etwas zu klein für den Türrahmen und wies rundum einen ca. 2 - 3 cm breiten Spalt auf, was bei nächtlichen Minusgraden und ohne Heizung nicht angenehm ist. Heißes Wasser gab es nicht, bestenfalls lauwarmes. Duschgel ebenfalls Fehlanzeige, aber ein Stückchen Handwaschseife war vorhanden. Die eine Nacht haben wir ausgehalten, aber es war schon sehr schade ums Geld. Das Positive an diesem Hotel waren der im Preis inkludierte Shuttleservice in die Stadt und das Frühstücksbuffet, welches neben Eiern, Speck, Würstchen, Joghurt, Müsli, Säften und einem wunderbar köstlichen Brot auch Quiche, Crepes und süßes Kleingebäck im Angebot hatte.","Date of stay: July 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"scarsetto e vecchiotto","una bella hall può ingannare ed infatti è così. la struttura è vecchia, poco pulita, nel letto c'era qualche insetto di troppo ed il condizionatore era rotto. meglio il safari court che è dello stesso gruppo ed ha quattro stelle ma costa di più.","Date of stay: October 2009This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very Accommodating Staff, Pleasant Grounds and Rooms","We spent 10 nights at the Safari Hotel, 3 before a booked 5-day trip/safari and 7 after. We found the staff to be very helpful with all requests. They loaned us a converter plug, they stored our luggage in a locked area while we went on our safari, they got taxi rides for us and we used the shuttle to get to town several times.They also let us switch rooms our second stay when the wifi wouldn't work. The only complaint is about the wifi. You have to get small slips of paper from the desk with codes on them to get on the wifi. The code only lasts so long so you are constantly putting in a new code, if you are choosing to get online at all. Sometimes it didn't work at all. We appreciated the free hotel shuttle that goes to two malls and the city center. They were prompt in picking us up and it was easy to use. There are two restaurants on the premises, one in the Safari Hotel and one in the Safari Court Hotel. There is a nice buffet breakfast in both places but you can only eat at the one at your own hotel. You can go to either for lunch or dinner but at times the Welwitschia at the Safari Hotel was closed. It seemed the Acacia at the Safari Court Hotel was a little more upscale but I think they both served the same things. The lunch and dinner buffets were delicious and varied with lots of different appetizers, salads, breads, dutch oven meats and vegetable dishes and desserts. There are two pool areas and I believe you can use either, not matter which hotel you stay at. The conference center is really the crowning jewel of this property - the building has wide hallways with counters to serve drinks and snacks. The conference rooms are huge with great video and audio systems. The reception area in that building accommodated signage and a big area for checking in for the conference. There's another building that is more of a hug tent that was used for a mixer - the food was nice every time there was a big party for conference goers. It says a lot about a hotel's kitchen staff when delicious food can be cranked out for 400+ people. Hot foods were hot and cold foods were cold. We would stay at this hotel again in the future if our travel plans took us there. Some reviewers have said it's old and dated. That didn't bother us. It was nice and the people who took care of us were nice too. It was an enjoyable stay.","Date of stay: November 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good value","This is a fine little hotel that is trying to be grand. The staff are extremely well trained and efficient and on more than one occasion went out of their way to solve small problems. The food at the buffet was excellent, both breakfast and dinner, and reasonably priced. The rooms were clean and neat. Bottled Water and tea was supplied. The grounds seemed quite secure and safe. The only thing that keeps me from giving it the full 5 stars is the pillows were uncomfortable and could do with replacing with better quality specimens.","Date of stay: September 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not what what I expected","The compound looks great, but once you are taken to your room things change completely. I had to call reception a few times as the fridge firstly didn't work and then I had no hot water. It took them over an hour to come look at to why there was no hot water and change my room on my second night. The second room had not bed cover and it was a single bed. When I asked them why there would be no hot water, I was told because they have solar heating and it has been cold so that is why. The second room had warm water, not hot and can someone start their day off freezing and uncomfortable. On you room service they charge you for a tray service which is absurd as you are staying with them longer than 1 night. The food (steak) was overcooked and cold.I will definitely never stay here again on my next trip when I am in town.","Date of stay: July 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"""транзитный"" отель, ничего сверх","Останавливались в данном отеле в сентябре 2016 года, когда совершали свое первое путешествие в далекую Африк (self-drive).Однозначно, отель не подходит для тех, кто планирует задержаться в Виндхуке для осмотра города, так как отель находится на окраине. Он идеально подходит для тех, кто по прилету в Африку хочет немного перевести дух, а на следующий день уже отправляться на изучение Намибии в более туристические места.Отель оформлен достаточно сдержанно. Еда, как нам показалась, была среднего уровня, но более, чем приемлемой за те деньги, что они просят в замен.Номер был явно не новым, но чистым и аккуратным. Большие кровати, телевизор, кондиционер. Единственный неприятный момент - еле теплая вода в душе начала идти только минут через 10 его использования. Чтобы было очень неудобно и немного подпортило общее впечатление.Отель однозначно рекомендую, но как ""транзитный"" вариант","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very dissapointing","The only positive point I can mention is that check in was friendly and efficient.  Everything went horribly wrong from there.  Reading some of the other reviews I have to agree with the comment that this hotel has not been upgraded or maintained since opening. I stayed in one of the the business rooms which was terribly outdated. I could not shower, because the water pressure was non existing. Wifi connection did not work in my room. The carvery offered was really bad quality, I could not get my knife through the lamb and the salads offered was dried out and unappealing. Breakfast was slightly better but still at the buffet table the staff was miserable and the food was poorly prepared.  There is no attention to detail in this hotel and for the price I am sure a person can get much better accommodation else where.","Date of stay: August 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice Place!","My husband and I spent one night at Hotel Safari after doing a camping trip through Zambia, Botswana, and Namibia in September 2012. After spending a couple weeks in tents, Hotel Safari was a nice change! Our tour guide mixed up the room reservations (we were supposed to have one with a king-sized bed but got two doubles instead) but that wasn't the hotel's fault, and we liked the room we ended up with. The large bathroom and shower were especially nice. We spent some time at the pool area, which was great, and also the indoor bar, which we quite enjoyed.Breakfast in the morning was a buffet and was delicious. Coffee was excellent. Hotel Safari is a nice spot and we would stay there again.","Date of stay: September 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Right Next To The Airport","With it's location, the hotel appears to cater mainly to the corporate/business traveler. I would class the room I received as barely 3 Star due to it's aged decor, tiny showering facilities and air conditioner that barely moved air, let alone chilled it.Dining facilities were great as were the staff we encountered for the most part. Two points that stood out however was that none of our group of travelers received any guidance as to the hotels facilities when checking in and the barman's knowledge at 9PM regarding such stables as Harvey Wallbangers, G&T, White Russians, Cosmopolitan stopped at pouring a beer - bizarre.","Date of stay: November 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The burglar bars, ink stamped pillow cases & a broken shower door that literally locks you inside the shower don't exactly create a sense of comfort & at almost N$1000 a night it is rather disappointing.I would definitely not stay here again, there are more luxurious places to stay for the same price.","Date of stay: June 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Just average","This hotel has seen better days. Furniture, carpets, bathrooms are fairly run-down and in need of renovations. Our room was a bit smelly, too. WiFi often not functional in the rooms, computer system needed to be constantly rebooted. Location a bit out of the way and not exactly convenient to downtown Windhoek. The cash machine in the lobby was out of cash. Front desk staff was not particularly friendly or helpful and most spoke and understood English very poorly. However, most of the wait staff was friendly and happy to help. Bar man refused to serve me at the bar when I went to fetch a drink to take outside to the pool.  He insisted I order at the table, so I had to wait 10 min until I was able to find a waiter (who was charming, however).  Breakfast was adequate for what it is. I cannot recommend this hotel and would not go back unless I had no other options.","Date of stay: March 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nella media","Ho soggiornato una notte al ""Safari Hotel"" al termine del mio viaggio in Namibia. Si trova appena fuori Windhoek, è infatti indispensabile un mezzo per raggiungere il centro della città; l'albergo mette a disposizione delle navette gratuite, ma consiglio di informarsi bene sugli orari (l'ultima navetta del giorno, almeno il giorno in cui c'ero io, era alle 14 circa...per cui al ritorno è stato necessario un taxi). Struttura grande, con camere spaziose, ma tutto piuttosto vecchio... Buona la cena a buffet al ristorante dell'albergo (circa 150 dollari namibiani, escluse le bevande). Wifi gratis! Nel complesso, niente di particolare...ma come punto di partenza o di arrivo per un viaggio in Namibia, va benissimo!","Date of stay: August 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Due notti al Safari Hotle","E' un hotel adatto unicamente per pernottare all'arrivo e al ritorno per un viaggio in Namibia. Lo scorso anno avevamo soggiornato al Safari Court, sempre nello stesso complesso, 4 stelle, ma la differenza non si nota granchè. Servizio scadente, pulizia appena decente, colazione abbastanza soddisfacente, camere ampie, il tutto in un ambiente decisamente decadente. Il centro e l'aereoporto si raggiungono facilmente con i bus navetta a disposizione dei clienti, se non si ha una propria vettura.

"Excellent mid-range hotel with good facilities","The Safari Hotel is great for a couple of nights stay at the beginning or end of your trip (especially if you have been camping!). The staff are very friendly and helpful and reception always well staffed. Free safety deposit box service, lockable wardrobe section in your room and plenty of security. I was travelling alone and it all felt very safe and friendly, unlike some of the guest houses which people on my tour felt were not so safe. There is a decent sized pool with plenty of sun loungers and a pool bar service for drinks and snacks. Couple of nice restaurants also which are fairly reasonably priced. I stayed in the business class room which was spacious and had all the comforts you would expect from this class of hotel and much appreciated air con! It's also easy to extend your check out time and arrange for airport transfers. I made good use of the free shuttle service which runs in and out of Windhoek centre every 30 mins and only takes about 5-10 mins to get there. Definitely don't let the fact this is not in the centre put you off, it's cheap and easy to arrange taxis to restaurants etc at night and even the places closer to the centre recommend taking taxis after about 8pm anyway. Recommend this one for a well priced hotel with good facilities and excellent service.","Date of stay: February 2008This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Need to improve","They change our rooms without any prior arrangements and we just have to except it. The room standards for what you pay is not good value for money. Their breakfast were great in the past but cutting back on the variety make it just another breakfast. Service at reception is still slow after so many years. The banquet service was just plain poor. No other words to use. I will call the staff arrogant.","Date of stay: October 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Safari Hotel Windhoek....not bad","We stayed at Safari Hotel Windhoek from 11- 13 May 2019 and then again on 17 May 2019. My first stay was however a lot better than the second. The hotel was ok, nothing special. My room was clean and functional and breakfast buffet served from 6.30 am was real good. However, the facilities in the rooms were dated and need an update. For instance, they still had a cathode ray TV. For my second stay, the electric kettle didn'work at all and the service was poor generally. However, if you looking for a safe, affordable,no frills hotel in Windhoek, Safari Hotel is a good choice.","Date of stay: May 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Outdated & Expired","I will not be thanking my travel agent for this reservation.While the staff are friendly and helpful and the in house dining good, the good size room was probably once upon a time one of the better hotels on the block, the current state of the rooms are just to dowdy and outdated at best. With the dark wood furniture, eighties light fixtures, and carpet that is just 'blah', nothing impresses me in the room.The TV is simply prehistoric and the adjoining bathroom pathetic.Somebody please update the entire bathroom as mould round the bathtub, is making it's rounds.Only consolation are the clean white towels and sheets, and comfy bed which were the saving grace. I would change hotels if I had more then a nights stay in Windhoek or alternatively book a stay in a nice modern apartment hosted by a 'Superhost' and there a so many attractive apartments and rooms available on the home sharing app, Airbnb, that would cost less then spend money on a outdated hotel. If there are modern and updated homes out in Windhoek there is no reason why this hotel cannot upgrade themselves to the current century.Breakfast is basic at best.Someone donate a toaster please!WiFi is same a most of Namibia but the internet expires daily with a new complicating password to renew daily.Too depressing rooms to take any nice pictures, I rather not, thanks!If you absolutely must stay here, I suggest you request for an upgraded room in the new wing.","Date of stay: December 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lodge and Rooms","I stayed twice, once at the beginning of a trip and once at the end. My first stay was in a lodge or motel style room. It's clean, spacious, comfortable. The second stay was in the business rooms - these are more luxurious - carpeted rooms in a multi-storey block, sockets to suit uk plugs, wifi in the room, and generally a better standard or repair. The communal areas are well presented. Good breakfast buffet. The wifi system is a bit of a nuisance. You need a free code for every 50mb fir every device which means collecting multiple bits of paper from reception with endless codes. However, it is possible to get connected for basic communication, if not photo uploading.","Date of stay: September 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Für einen kurzen Aufenthalt in Ordnung","Unser Zimmer war sehr abgewohnt, vor allem die Badezimmer benötigen dringend eine Renovierung. Das Abendessen (Buffet), sah zunächst super aus, war geschmacklich aber das schlechteste Essen, was ich in 12 Tagen Namibia konsumiert habe. Das Frühstück hingegen war Top und bietet eine tolle Auswahl. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Wlan funktioniert hier auch in den Zimmern, was aber das einzige Schmackhafte an den Zimmern ist. Wir haben in den Nebengebäuden gewohnt mit Aussicht auf einen ""Garten"" und eine Mauer.

"Nie wieder","Wir waren am Ende einer Rundreise mit der Gruppe dort für 1 Nacht. Länger hätte man es auch nicht ausgehalten. Wir wurden in einem abgelegenen Trakt untergebracht (Unser Zimmer: 16A). Einrichtung aus den 70er-Jahren des letzten Jahrtausends. Muffiger Geruch. Badezimmer nicht sehr sauber und rudimentär ausgestattet. In der Dusche funktionierte ausserdem der Abfluss nicht, so dass man nach kurzer Zeit in einem See stand. Fenster sind vergittert, die Bahntrasse führt direkt vorbei, startende und landende Flugzeuge in greifbarer Nähe. Unserer Beobachtung nach wurden  Zimmer in diesem Trakt auch als Personalzimmer genutzt. Ein unschöner Abschluss einer schönen Reise.","Date of stay: March 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Dated and worn out, but with (mostly) friendly service","I stayed at Hotel Safari for one night during a business trip to Windhoek. I'm afraid it wasn't the best experience.First, so. many. cats. Stray cats everywhere. They feed stray cats (see photo) which has its benefits in keeping other undesirable creatures away, but also, eew. The room itself was rather dated. You could tell that they had made every effort to clean it as best they could, but there comes a time when a serious refurbishment is needed. This time has come for Hotel Safari. This time came for Hotel Safari a while ago!The televisions are old CRT-type TVs. The TV was also very unclear. The bed linens were clean but very, very worn (see photos). The linens also had the hotel name stamped on them which made me think of a correctional institution (at least that's how they look on TV), but who knows, maybe threadbare sheet theft is a thing in Windhoek.The bathroom was a challenge. It was just so antiquated! I had to force myself into the shower and it was a most unpleasant experience.You should not step out of a shower feeling ickier than when you stepped in. And for some inexplicable reason the towels (which looked very clean I must say) smelt of roast lamb.I had a drink in the hotel bar and dinner in the restaurant. The service in the bar was strange. The barmen and waiters walked past me for a good 15 minutes until I managed to catch one's eye to get service. The drinks list was very limited with their best wines not being very good at all (although to be positive this meant that prices were very reasonable).The dinner was a disappointment. The buffet cost N$175 per person but I'd be hard-pressed to see how they could charge more than N$50 for that meal! Service in the restaurant was atrocious. Our waiter disappeared for long stretches of time; this was clearly a result of poor training and not the waiter's fault.Even though I've painted a very grim picture in this review I must point out that the service was very friendly. The check-in and check-out processes were efficient, and the housekeeping staff were very friendly.","Date of stay: September 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Generally everything of a good standard, although there was rip in the net curtains, a broken bin lid and the large key ring and stiff lock made getting into the room a bit of a noisy struggle.Bought internet cards from reception which worked in the room, although fairly slow and did not always log off correctly wasting paid minutes.Reasonable pool, but water heavy with chemical and no shade for the loungers, although there are tables and chairs under thatched open-sided “huts”.Staff friendly and very helpful, but generally slower waiter service than in the US or Europe.Breakfast buffet style with reasonable hot choice, but no fresh fruit and limited selection of cold meats and cheese.Taxis easily arranged by reception into town.","Date of stay: November 2008This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great option, very friendly staff","We stayed here in late December for a 1 night stopover between Cape Town and London.The hotel suits the formula for this type. Rooms were spacious and clean. Air-conditioning worked, but was a bit louder than we would've liked. (Although not loud enough to stop us using it. Bathroom had separate bath and shower (although this may be dependant on which room you're allocated) which were both clean. Staff were very friendly, customer service was great. We were given a welcome basket on the ocassion of our anniversary, we were allowed to checkout after 17h00, etc. etc.The hotel is under renovation, try and get one of the newly renovated rooms. Upon arrival our 'first room' had a plumbing problem and we were moved to another. These things happen - the mark of a good hotel is how they are dealt with. There was no fuss or problem in moving us, so the hotel scores for customer service. We even got upgraded to a slightly smarter room in the deal.The hotel has a pool in the complex. There is a also a bar and restaurant. Breakfast was pretty formulaic for this type of hotel - nothing to get excited about but enough to get the day going.Location of the hotel complex is okay, it's on the outskirts of town. I guess most people will have a hired car as that is the nature of Namibia. The hotel is about a 10m drive from the centre of Windhoek. They also run a shuttle service to the centre of town which we used when we didn't feel like driving ourselves. This was clean and reliable so no problems here.All in all, we were very happy and would likely stay here again. Value in terms of space and service relative to rates (when paying in £) is incomparable to UK hotels so for tourists paying in strong currencies used to European hotels and rates, you'll likely find this a great option offering a high class of accommodation for what seems like very little.","Date of stay: December 2006This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Reasonable value for 3 star establishment","DISCLAIMER: Safari Hotels have two separate hotels at the location.  One is a three star and the other is a four star.  The former is called the Safari Hotel and the latter the Safari Court Hotel.  There is obviously a cost difference between the two but they do share various facilities so if you have budget constraints then go for the cheaper option.  It is OK but the rooms are a bit tired and in need of renovation.  Service is good and the hotel does have an excellent conference venue and nice bars and restaurants.  Next time I would stay in the Safari Court.","Date of stay: December 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I am a cat lover but was quite disgusted to find a plethora of neglected cats and kittens around the rooms.  Visited the hotel a few years ago and it has definitely deteriorated since then.  The food, when it finally arrived, was good.  Breakfast wasn't bad but is it necessary to put scones, topped with jam and cream under warming lamps?  All in all, it was a very disappointing experience.","Date of stay: November 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The first night there they were having a function and only informed people who were not at the function, as you came to dinner, the normal menu will not be served tonight and we had to select food from a snack menu. I had a very sub-standard pork chop. Service was slow. The rooms are from the 1980's and I had a big burn mark and stain on the bedside table. The chair at the desk was falling appart and the AC was either freezer cold or not on. The staff was not friendly and the whole place smells like a marsh. I will not stay here again.

Kaffee und Tee werden gebracht.","Date of stay: September 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Confortable et luxe","A l'encart de la ville et adossé au Mercure ( on a pris le petit déjeuner et le dîner au Mercure échange de bons procédés à cause des travaux !) l'hôtel est très verdoyant, avec un grand parking et luxueux. De grandes chambres accueillantes , bien équipées, confortables. Dommage qu'en mai la piscine soit déjà trop froide ! Les repas étaient sous forme de buffet assez variés et comme partout en Namibie les boissons ne sont pas coûteuse , vin ou bière.","Date of stay: June 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"No thanks!","The Hotel is mainly for group tours. It contains two parts. Old part were one level hotel rooms. Tired and depressing. We stayed there a total of two nights. One for pre-tour and one for end of the tour stay. Both time, we're put to these uninteresting and unclean rooms. The newish part is a highrise building, looked a bit more presentable and the staff seemed more courteous.  Pros: Shuttle bus to downtown and shopping centre. Cons: Reception: Very average Restaurant: Dirty and unattractive. Service was very slow. Food was tasteless. Staff just kept talking loudly to each other at all times.","Date of stay: August 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Beautiful Compound and Excellent Service","The Safari Hotel is a large compound in Windhoek.  I stayed there for a conference in their conference center.The service is very good and the rooms are nice.  I was staying in one of the executive rooms.

"Needs Upgrading","Friendly and efficient check in! Rooms although spacious are very outdated and could do with a good clean. Lights are full of insects! TV from the dark ages and can hardly view the channels. The air conditioner needs serious upgrading and is so loud you can barely sleep. Bar fridge available but is empty! Get 2 complimentary waters. Rooms do have coffee and tea facilities although not the best. Shower had good pressure. I found the free wifi consistent. Dinner not a great experience. Asked for rare chops came well done. Vegetables cold. Undercooked potatoes. Pepper sauce cold. Will say staff friendly and accommodating.

"Enjoyable stay","Having read the reviews here it was with some trepidation that I arrived. Sure the rooms are dated, but they are very spacious and clean. They have everything you need. The public spaces are great and the staff are brilliant. I especially liked the pool area, and the peacful atmosphere. On this trip I have stayed in both hotels and have no complaints. The hotel decor reminds me of Four star chains in the US in the 80's. - dated and tired, but basically OK. My one major gripe is constantly having to enter stupid codes to access the internet.

Bei uns funktionierte weder Kühlschrank noch Klimaanlage.Die Businesszimmer sind teuer, ebenfalls in die Jahre gekommen, hier kann man froh sein, wenn die Duschen funktionieren. Aber man kann zwischen den Wasserstrahlen hin und her hüpfen um einen abzubekommen. Übelster Geruch in den Zimmern nach Schimmel oder versifftem Teppichboden.

"Mix bag","Overall the staff are the best asset of this hotel - in my experience they pick-up what is in essence a fairly tired place. The rooms are very outdated and basic with aircons that make more noise than cool air and a radio that badly receives only one (German) station. The main building (reception and the restaurant) is somewhat better and the staff were friendly and very helpful. Food is pretty standard and a bit below average - even for tired buffet fare. Also far from town if you're here w/o your own transport. So fine and good value for a short stay, but I won't recommend much more.","Date of stay: November 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Adequate for our needs","We stayed at The Safari Hotel for one night at the beginning of November.  The staff were all very helpful and attentive.  We ate in the restaurant as it was the easiest option rather than wandering in unknown surroundings.  There was a carvery and a large choice of buffet items.  It was very reasonably priced and adequate.  The breakfast was excellent.  The rooms are very spread out.  They are a bit dated but everything was clean.  It was a suitable start to our safari.","Date of stay: November 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A mediocre hotel/motel","A warm welcome met us in the smart foyer of the Safari Hotel, which promised much for our stay there. However, amongst our large group we had mixed opinions about our overall night's stay. We were accommodated in motel style rooms, most of which were in clear need of some tlc and refurbishment. Two of our rooms had an overbearing odour of cigarette smoke. When we mentioned this to reception, we were told that housekeeping would be round later to sort it out. The smell was so bad, we ended up insisting that we be moved, and in fairness we were. However, we were moved to a room with a faulty kettle, a chain lock that was not usable and a sink that didn't drain well. It was quite noisy late at night, though that was due to certain guests and I can't blame the hotel for that (though perhaps the security might have encouraged the 3am game players to quieten down a little!?).The whole place just needed some care! That said, the pool was fine (but very cold) as was the bar. In the morning, it was a buffet breakfast, but it was not great. The food was fairly tasteless and there was not much of it. It was certainly the first time in Namibia where I was left disappointed by the food on offer.If you're staying in Windhoek, I'd suggest there are better places for the price (such as the Arebbusch Lodge).","Date of stay: July 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"da evitare","Il Safari Hotel si trova fuori da Windhoek in prossimità del vecchio aeroporto. La posizione è piuttosto scomoda, senza auto non si può raggiungere nulla. Le camere sono vecchie e anonime. Noi avevamo una camera al piano terra ed era anche molto fredda. Nessuno aveva verificato che funzionasse il riscaldamento e a giugno in Namibia fa decisamente freddo. Il personale dell'hotel è freddo e distaccato e la reception non si capisce quale funzione abbia, dato che si ha l'impressione che il personale sia infastidito da ogni tipo di richiesta. La colazione è servita nella struttura centrale ed è abbondante e sufficientemente varia. Non consiglio questa struttura, è stata la mia peggiore esperienza in Namibia.","Date of stay: June 2010This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Budget Hotel -- Don't expect more","Located in an odd corner of town, convenient to Eros Airport but not much else, this is the older, uglier sister to the neighboring Safari Court Conference Hotel, which charges more and offers more.Internet, for instance.  There is no internet service or wireless option in the Safari rooms.  You have to buy a voucher and go to the Safari Court business center.  If you don't plan to spend much time in your room, or eat any fresh fruit or healthy bread for breakfast, this is an adequate place to stay.    Given the usual standard of Namibian and southern African hospitality, however, the Safari was a reasonably-priced, but characterless disappointment.","Date of stay: July 2008This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Standards Have Dropped .......","Sunday 07th July -The last time i stayed in the hotel safari was in May 2012 , after a long 11hour flight from London then. 8 hour delay in Joburg due to the misplacement of my bag .I arrived in Windhoek and an hours drive from the airport I arrived at the SH .Once again check-in was painless and the female receptionist was helpful and quick which was good after all the travelling and waiting around in airports all I wanted to do was have a long shower and relax .I was given a basement room which was big , with 2 big beds all for me .Rooms at the Safari are not cheap and the scuff / scratch marks on the walls were a bit of a let down .During my shower it was also disappointing that the ceiling and coveing was black with mould . This build up is down to poor cleaning standards but because I was in need of a good hot shower I carried on .My bed was comfy with clean sheets and bedding , later in the evening I ordered a egg-burger snack to my room while I was watching the wimbledon tennis highlights on the telly .The food arrived very plainly , no tray , just my burger and chips on a plate covered in cling film . The waiter / porter gave me my bill to sign and then pointed out the cost of the food and hinted on a tip ! ..... I pointed out to him the delivery cost of the plate that was also on the bill , i said that's your tip .After eating airport food I was looking forward to my burger it was ok but the bun was burnt which surprised me .......if you are preparing a meal and you burn it and you know it's not the best ......why give it to the customer ....Why !!!The next day on checking out I discussed the shower and food concerns with the receptionist and I left for a short trip offshore.Now lets fast forwards to yesterday Friday 12th July - Again I was staying overnight in the Safari and then the next day I was travelling to London via Joburg .This time I was given a similar double bed basement room identical to the one I had on Sunday , this room was clean , comfy bed and the shower ceiling and coving were gleaming white .I decided to have a meal in the restaurant the waiter explained there was a buffet service or I could go ""a la carte"" I fancied a nice T- bone steak with all the trimmings and a boat jug of black pepper sauce .I like my steak medium and juicy and I waited drooling for my meal , when it arrived it looked tasty then when I started cutting into the steak it was a struggle .Each mouthful was a struggle - tough to chew , tasteless and a poor quality of meat .Infact I couldn't eat it I had to remove the tasteless mess from my mouth .The waiter asked me was I enjoying my meal I said NO the steak is tough and chewy I said good steak is succulent and full of flavour and sadly this is well below standard.He never battered a eyelid , he never said I'm sorry about that .....and then nothing he just removed my plate .After about 5 mins the waiter gave me the bill for my meal to sign , this shocked me the main attraction to my meal was the steak and it was a poor cut of meat , no flavour and tough . The chief who cooked it must have known its wasn't the best bit of cooking he had done .......but after all this I was still given a bill for 105 N$ .I told the waiter I wasn't happy and in the morning I also told the receptionist .I would have been embarrassed to have given a bill to a unhappy paying customer .High standards are paramount in a restaurant , sadly maybe this was a one off but for me it wasn't just the steak that left a poor taste in my mouth .Yes the restaurant is clean and stylish but if the cooking and presenting of the food is below standard No amount of smiles from the waiters will make up for the poor food . Having a meal is a total experience if the food is poor that will be the only thing that will be remembered .","Date of stay: July 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Rather Not... ","Recently stayed in the Safari Hotel for a conference and was not impressed at all. Their reception area looks modern and clean and then I went to my room.... Carpets were dirty and smelled of dust, toilet didn't want to flush properly, shower wouldn't drain in the bath, taps were rusted and the cupboard was dirty. So I basically didn't even unpack my bag. Breakfast was fine, staff not always friendly. Conference room was set up badly and again the carpets smelled of dust. Staff weren't able to assit delegates with finding the conference room because they themselves had no idea we were even there! Lunch was terrible, one day offered only fish and rice with some carrot salad (I am allergic to fish and don't eat rice) I ended up having a little carrot salad as that was all that was available for me. The coffee and tea table were mostly left empty so we couldn't even enjoy that. Some staff were not friendly and others were. 3 horrible nights and I absolutely loathed them. I am sad to say I had a terrible experience here. Perhaps others would say different but I was absolutely disappointed and let down as this was my first time in Namibia.","Date of stay: September 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Help given quickly and efficiently when you really needed","We would probably only give this hotel a Poor rating, or at best an Average rating expect for the fact that they really helped out when we needed them. We had checked into our room early afternoon on a Thursday, and already returned our hire vehicle, since we were joining a Nomad Africa Overland Tour departing from the hotel early the following morning. Thus we were without our own, private transport, when mid-afternoon my wife suddenly and unexpectedly required rapid medical attention. We immediately went to the hotel reception, who quickly arranged for their shuttle-bus driver, Silas, to drive us to a private hospital, where my wife was able to consult a doctor and be prescribed appropriate medication - thus allowing us to continue with our holiday uninterrupted. Silas also provided us with his mobile phone number so that we were able to call him when we were finished, for him to drive us back to our hotel. Silas was very kind and helpful, as were all the staff at the hotel reception - and we were not even charged for the shuttle bus drive to and from the hospital. Thank you very much Silas and Safari Hotel - we really appreciate your help when we most needed it.As for the rest - well the hotel is very dated (think early 1970s at latest) and our room was exceedingly run down. The desk was broken and the refrigerator did not work. There was a large opening in the middle of the head board of the bed, which clearly used to contain a built-in radio - the radio was no longer there but the hole was, as were the wires that used to connect to the radio. On the morning we left, we discovered that (despite running the hot water a very long time) there was no hot water, so had to take a cold shower (no time to call reception and ask them to attend to the problem).Dinner at hotel restaurant consisted of a self-service menu of not particularly exciting or tasty dishes, usually lukewarm at best; likewise for the breakfast buffet.Also note that the hotel is situated right next to the main take-off runway for the local airport (not to be confused with Windhoek International Airport which is located far out of town). Because of this, one can hear the noise of all the small planes as they taxi to the end of the runway, before accelerating for take-off.Personally, we would not choose this hotel again if we had an alternative, but note that they DO help you quickly and efficiently should you be unfortunate enough to need to see a doctor.","Date of stay: November 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Die Zimmertür selbst ist eine einfache Holztür, welche nicht dicht und schallgeschützt ist. Somit konnten Ameisen in mein Zimmer laufen und waren überall auf dem Boden verteilt. Das Zimmer selbst ist wie in den 60er / 70er Jahren ausgestattet, mit einer Sitzecke, welche jedoch aufgrund der Sauberkeit leider nicht zum Verweilen einlädt. Auch der Tisch war nicht abgewischt und Krümel befanden sich noch darauf. Die Vorhänge wurden längere Zeit nicht gewaschen und die Stand-Klimaanlage habe ich lieber aus gelassen, da diese auch sehr verstaubt war. Das Zimmer selbst war schön groß und die Betten gut, habe gut geschlafen. Auf dem Zimmer befindet sich ein Rucksack-Fernseher mit zwei deutschen Sendern. Das Bad ist einfach ausgestattet mit einer älteren Duschkabine und dunklen Fliesen. WLAN ist nur im Hauptgebäude in der Lobby kostenfrei verfügbar. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist relativ überschaubar, Kaffee wird mit einer Haushalts-Kaffeemaschine für alle Gäste gekocht und nur auf Nachfrage gereicht. Die Säfte sind mit Wasser aus einem Sirup gemischt und richtig süß. Richtig satt bin ich leider nicht geworden zum Frühstück. Die Freundlichkeit der Mitarbeiter ist auch verbesserungsfähig. Für eine Nacht war es in Ordnung.","Date of stay: March 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"not happy","We only right this review to hi light the poor service and attitude of the staff. We had booked this room from Australia thru Qantas. When we arrived to check in we where told there was no booking even when we had a booking Number and confirmation number. We requested to talk with the manager who was belligerent at best we advised this booking was made thru Qantas and was a very reputable company to which the manger said flippantly never heard of them. Our only recourse in her eyes was to buy another room. Very poor form at an international hotel complex. The room quality was very poor and the breakfast was poor. Tables left cluttered from other dinners and a lot of missing cutlery  when we did get somewhere to sit. Overall this was a very poor experience.","Date of stay: October 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A fine hotel","This hotel might not be competing for best hotel in Namibia but is is fine for what it is. Comfortable big rooms with a clean bathroom is really all you need when your arrive or leave Windhoek and this hotel has all that. It is nothing special but perfectly fine. We didn’t use it but I understand that they also have a shuttle as it is a bit far from the town center.","Date of stay: May 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Für eine Nacht ok","Nichts besonderes, aber für eine Nacht ok. Zimmer, obwohl schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen, sauber und gepflegt.Frühstück mit allem was man braucht. Abendbuffet hatten wir (als Gruppe) im Safari Court Hotel. Sehr zu empfehlen.Kostenfreier Shuttle Service zur Innenstadt. Avis Autovermietung direkt neben dem Hotel.Das Personal machte auf mich im Safari Court Hotel einen freundlicheren Eindruck, war im Safari aber auch akzeptabel.Alles in allem für einen Anreise- oder Abreise-Tag in Ordnung.","Date of stay: April 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"never again","Schlechtes Hotel für namibische Verhältnisse. Das Safari Court ist um Welten besser! Unfreundliches Personal an der Reception und bei Problemen wills niemand gewesen sein. Wir wurden zuerst im falschen Zimmer untergebracht und wurden dann im Hotelzimmer selbst beklaut während wir beim Nachtessen waren. Auch da gibt es keine Hilfe vom Hotel. Safari Court ist super für eine Übernachtung - Safari Hotel nein danke.","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Shocking","Had no hot water either in the evening nor the morning. Had no bed covers. Second storey room with no lift, with no offer of assistance from any staff. Everything in the room/complex way past sell by date. Reception area creates a false impression of what the hotel is really all about. Personally took up the issues with the manager and the assistant manager upon check-out - total apathy regards our complaints. The manager even had the audacity to state that he sleeps in one of same rooms and also did not have hot water and that they cannot get a plumber to repair the problem over a weekend - well why were then then dishonest and not inform us of the issue upon check-in. Any decent establishment would have at least have apologised or offered some sort of discount - not this establishment","Date of stay: July 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Night of cockroaches at Safari Court- windhoek","I stayed at Safari Court , Windhoek, Namibia,3 nights and checked out today. The 1st and the 2nd night was a nightmare, with cockroaches allover my bedroom. Even though I reported it the first day, nothing was done until I called a night staff, on day 2, to witness the cockroaches I killed. Then only did they spray with doom. No formal apology was made, instead it seemed as if I was nagging them. Very bad experience. The restuarant made up a bit with a great hospitality and kindness while having breakfast and dinner.","Date of stay: April 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Trapped in a time warp","Reminds me if the motel Bruce Willis holes up in in the film pulp fiction. 1960's style road trip motel rooms with curtains to match. Tv works on cathode ray technology and headboard has a built in radio that doesn't work. Wifi rationed with little tokens of 500mb at a time, staff moderately interested in your welbeing.  Clean enough and novel, but pretty impersonal you're probably better off in a bnb.","Date of stay: February 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"An- und Abreisehotel und schnell weg","Die Zimmer sind ausreichend groß. Leider war der Strahl aus der Dusche nur sehr dünn. Es gibt auch deutsches TV, jedoch waren die meisten Programme im Schnee zu sehen. Die Rezeption ist freundlich und schnell.Wer jedoch das Restaurant nutzen muss, und das machen die meisten recht großen Reisegruppen, der erlebt am Büffet so mache Überraschung. Vieles ist leergeräumt und es kommt selten etwas nach. Wir nahmen a la Carte, die Preise sind o.k., jedoch war das Steak in einer grausamen Qualität. Die Bedienung kannte die Probleme und hat uns netterweise mit etwas Süssem entschädigt.Der Pool ist überlicherweise kalt. Der Service im Außenbereich hatte es leider nicht nötig gebrauchtes Geschirr weg zuräumen oder Scherben vom Boden zu beseitigen.","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Had to move me 4 times to a habitable room","The first room allocated on arrival, fridge didn't work, aircon broken, not clean.Gave me another room, basin drain blocked, toilet seat damaged, power went off at 6:35 am, then water as well.  Reported blocked drain and toilet seat.  Arrived back after a day's work to find nothing repaired, drain still blocked, and drinking glasses left dirty.After complaining, they gave me yet another room, fridge didn't work, aircon broken, dirty glasses.After speaking a manager, was given yet another room in the ""business class"" building - much better, but glasses still dirty, and fittings very old.  At least drain not blocked, and toilet seat OK.This hotel is evidently owned and run by a Mrs Spies, a charming lady whom I met on my last stay in the Safari Court hotel next door.  She really needs to find out what is going on in this wreck of a hotel.  I am paying top dollar for three nights, and this has been a real disaster.  I'm OK now in the ""business class"" room.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good hotel with ""tired"" rooms","We stayed as part of a tour group. The hotel is in spacious grounds with a swimming pool and has a very nice dining room and bar. However the room we were given was old and tired. It really could do with a revamp and be brought into the 21st century. The food was very good and the bar is good but beware if you ask for a glass of wine as you get given a carafe which is +/- 2 glasses. You don't get asked if you want it - you just get given it. The service was very friendly and the stay overall was not bad but work needs to be done to the rooms.","Date of stay: May 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Was jetzt?","Auf Tripadvisor habe ich leider keine Möglichkeit einer Kontaktaufnahme gefunden und schreibe hier allgemein meine Bewertung - über Tripadvisor:Liest man die Bewertungen etwa vom SAFARI HOTEL in WINHUK/Namibia, ist die Gemütsstimmung zwischen ""da muss ich hin"" bis ""Hilfe, da soll ich wohnen""!! Eine derartige Spannweite der Empfindungen von sauber oder dreckig bzw. sehr nette Bedienung und unfreundlich, hilft niemanden. Damit erntet man im Vorfeld einer möglichen Buchung nur Kopfschütteln und Unsicherheit. Ich habe die Idee hinter einer Bwertungsplattform schon verstanden - aber so etwas ist NICHT HILFREICH. Gibt es da keine Kontrolle oder Agents, die verlässlich ihre Komentare posten oder zumindest verlässliche Stichproben machen.Ich weiss heute nicht, was mich am Freitag früh erwartet: Helle Freude oder blankes Entsetzen. Somit kann ich Tripadvisor nur einen Stern geben. Schon alleine dafür, dass man nicht direkt eine Kritik an Tripadvisor schicken kann.","Date of stay: September 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Wonderful Stay","I booked two rooms via Amoma.com on the internet for a two night stay @ Safari Hotel Windhoek.  Little confusion at reception with our booking but Elizabeth sorted it out in no time.  The rooms were very clean and comfortable, the breakfast was 5 star quality and we enjoyed our stay at the Safari Hotel very much.  We make use of room service in the evenings and this was done speedy :)  You will see us again.","Date of stay: May 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good for conferences or big groups","I stayed at the Safari for five nights attending a conference and I found the overall experience very satisfactory. It is not my first time to Windhoek so I know that it has several good places to stay for a very reasonable price. Hence, the difference I see in the Safari is that it is well suited to what seems to be its two major group of clientele, conference participants and groups of tourists heading to or returning from the many tourist destinations in the country. Reception staff show a good degree of professionalism and courtesy but I think this behavior needs to be consistent. The girl who checked me in was actually quite aloof at first and was barely paying attention to me while I waited at the counter for nearly ten minutes to ask one simple question. This got me very angry and I was considering talking to management when this same girl responded to my requests very politely and in the most friendly manner just after about an hour. In terms of the amenities it is important to remember that the Safari actually is two hotels in one place. Apparently the Safari Court is the better one and costs slightly more than the Safari Hotel which is rather old and a bit cheaper. I stayed in the latter and all in all it is not bad. The most inconvenient thing about it for me was the key with its large key holder. I don't know how much it would cost to change to automatic digital locks from these old ones but I am sure it would make a lot of difference in improving the appeal of the hotel. If I were to decide not to stay at this place next time, it would certainly be because of the old locks and keys.  Food is not bad in the morning and for lunch when most things are fresh but the dinner menu seems to be taken out of the fridge and put on the buffet. The only consolation was that the standing chefs can make you great stir fried dish as you wait. Since you have choices between beef, chicken and game or even plain vegetarian this I think is the best bet. One other inconvenience I think may put off many people is the difficult internet connection. It rarely works in the rooms so you have to go to the lobby if you want to get a connection and even then it can be quite unreliable as the speed goes up and down frequently. Oh and one other thing. The room services. Dont try the room service unless you are desperately tired. It could take them anything between forty five minutes and an hour if at all they remember to come. I was equally disappointed when I was told that I can not get an iron and iron board to press my shirts for my meeting in the morning. What is more, they charge 3 USD if you want your shirt pressed (double if it is urgent). This, I think is totally unacceptable for a conference venue whose main clients are meeting participants that are very likely to need such a service. I believe it is wrong if the hotel is trying to make money out of such services. So in general my stay at the Safari was pleasant but not really outstanding. Would I stay here again? Only if I am attending a meeting there. Otherwise I am sure there are other equally good places in the city center.","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Der absoulte Top Urlaub","Das Camp ist hervorragend, die achteckigen Zelte sind bestens ausgestattet. Hier gibt es einen fest gemauerten Waschtisch und gemauerte und getrennte DU und WC. Steckdosen, Schreibtisch, Moskitonetz, Terasse mit 2 Stühlen und Öllampe. Im Zelt gibt es eine Taschenlampe (da ab ca. 23. 00 Uhr-05. 00 Uhr kein Strom!) und eine Trillerpfeife für Notfälle. Außerdem gibt es einen Klingelknopf, damit man bei Dunkelheit und für Gepäckservice einen Massai rufen kann, dieser bringt die Gäste sicher zum Hauptgebäude. Das Camp ist unter deutscher Leitung, der Service ist super. Das Restaurant bot abends ein 4Gang Wahlmenue von sehr guter Qualität, das Frühstücksbuffet war umfangreich und ebenfalls sehr gut. Es gibt auch richtige Zimmer in Bungalows und neuerdings einen Pool mit Wellnessbereich. All dies ist direkt in der Wildnis (Steppe), ohne Zaun direkt neben den Warzenschweinen, Impalas und Erdhörnchen.","This review is the subjective opinion of an individual traveler and not of Tripadvisor LLC nor of its partners.

"A Namibian Jem","I stayed one night at the Safari hotel , the next day I had a flight in a  small fixed wing plane to a dust runway in the middle of no where then I flew by helicopter for 1hour over the world famous ""skeleton desert "" to the offshore rig I was working on but that's another story .The Safari hotel is a nice complex I was living in a chalet type room, the room was clean , but after my epic flight from Spain to Paris , then a 10 1/2 hour over night flight to Joburg  , then a short flight to Namibia to Windhoek , then a 2 hour drive to the Safari hotel all I wanted was a shower and a change of clothes .Arriving at the hotel reception the formalities were very quick and the staff very professional .There was a big pool and bar at the Safari hotel side , a short walk over to Safari Court there they also have a pool and a gym.Everywhere is clean and tidy and the staff are always busy all over the safari complex .A couple of minors issues , I was given a wifi Internet code ticket but this was for only 2 hours after that you have to pay for more time .....WHY on 2 hours ?I was getting picked up the next morning so I asked reception to give me a early morning call at 6am , I didn't need the early call because a group of people leaving to go on a early morning Safari woke me up at 4am they had no consideration of others sleeping they were talking loudly with each other and on their mobile phones - this issue I discussed with reception during my checking out , they said they would pass on my concerns to their manager .But I don't want to be all doom and gloom , I would have liked to have stayed longer and the thought of going on a safari would have been a dream come true .The safari complex is well run , clean and good value for money  - there is a restaurant but I had a small meal sent to my room so I could watch the football on the TV  .There is a bar in the reception building and there are bars outside by the pool , the hotel has a free shuttle bus service for people who want to go to a near by shopping mall and Windhoek city centre .For the short time I was here I did enjoy my stay over the past 6 months I have stayed in hotels in 6 African countries and the Safari Hotel is by far the best , so well done to all the managers and staff  keep up the the excellent work you are doing and you never know maybe I will come back with my family for a Safari holiday .,,Thank you again and Good luck","Date of stay: April 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice hotel if you don't want to be in the city centre","I stayed here for one night at the end of a group tour. The complex is nice and the pool is a good place to relax after a busy schedule. There was a good selection of food at breakfast. Housekeeping were very efficient but the bar service slow - quite often there was no-one there during opening hours. Like a lot of Namibia, there seemed to be more staff than guests. I didn't use the free shuttle but it's a good idea as the city centre is quite far away. Be careful when getting a taxi to the airport - I was told by the hotel the price would be 200 dollars, when I came to pay the taxi driver told me it was 280 and friends of mine paid 200 each (400 dollars for the taxi).","Date of stay: January 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Maybe the worst hotel I have ever been in","After 2 amazing weeks in Namibia we arrived at the Safari Hotel and I was so disappointed. The rooms are very dreary, beds were dirty, view on the local airport which is right next door, broken toilet seats, etc. In the first night I woke up, standing in bed because of shock as my tab automized itself and the warm water started to run with an unbelievable loud noise. As this started I was awake because I couldn't turn of the water anymore and the noise continued hours and I needed to let the water run for hours and that in Africa. I complained several times at the reception and nothing happened. At 11am the plumber showed finally up and repaired it. No ""sorry for the inconvenience "" or similar I heard from the personnel. I always put the ""do not disturb"" on the door as I don't need room service for just two nights, but they still entered the room several times which is not acceptable, especially because the safe didn't work. Breakfast was like a mass processing: food not good, cold or empty - some people of my travel group had stomach problems after the breakfast. And the breakfast room is old and dirty as well. The pool area was also dirty. People had lunch there and 2 hours after they finished somebody came to remov eplates and cutlery which meant that several animals came to eat leftovers and the wind also moved cans within the pool area. Water was dirty as well so that nobody could take a swim.","Date of stay: October 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The bathroom is decent with a glass wall shower which sometimes splashes water out if you are not careful. The breakfast was adequate with made to order omelettes. There is a bar and the foyer offers some good waiting areas. All areas are air conditioned which was very welcome. There is a shopping centre about a 5 minute drive away.","Date of stay: July 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappointing","A colleague and I stayed at the Safari Hotel for two nights earlier this month as we were utilising their conference centre for an exhibition. I had also promoted their services to my clients, despite the fact that their rates were not particularly competitive. We were allocated a room amongst a very noisy tour group and when we complained about the noise we were ""upgraded"" to a so-called business class room. There was no hot water and the room was filthy. The noise level in this block was even worse and we had to call reception to send security to sort out the neighbours. We complained about the lack of cleanliness but nothing was done. General upkeep is poor, frayed wires on the kettle, stains on the carpets...... We attempted room service once to obtain some milk but were told that the chef had gone off duty so they couldnt help us!! The only saving grace is the staff who on the whole were extremely friendly, especially those working at the Conference Centre. I will definitely make use of the conference facilities again but will choose alternate accommodation.","Date of stay: June 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"niemals 3 Sterne","Wir waren im Dezember 2012 zweimal dort untergebracht während einer 2wöchigen Safari. Wir hatten also Gelegenheit 2 verschiedene Zimmer ""auszuprobieren"". Leider waren beide Erfahrungen ungenügend. Die Zimmer sind schmuddelig, sehr alt und die Klimaanlage verursacht einen Heidenlärm. Die Angestellten sind nicht wirklich hilfsbereit. Das Frühstück sollte um 6:30 losgehen. Wir mussten früh los für unsere Safari. Um halb sieben war der Raum noch verschlossen und als dieser geöffnet wurde, ging es noch etwa eine viertel Stunde, bis Gläser für O-Saft, Brot, der Toastapparat usw. am Buffet aufgetischt wurden. Ich kann das Safari Hotel niemandem mit gutem Gewissen empfehlen. Ich bin überzeugt, dass es in Windhoek viel Besseres für viel weniger Geld gibt.","Date of stay: December 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"No me gustó","La última noche en Namibia nos alojamos en este hotel, menos mal que sólo fue una noche porque no me gustó nada. No hay que confundirlo con el Hotel Court Safari que está en el mismo complejo y es más lujoso (al menos la zona de recepción). Cuando llegamos a la recepción del Court Safari creíamos que nuestro habitación estaría en este edificio, pero está en el edificio de al lado mucho más viejo y desencantado. La habitación que nos asignaron al principio tenía lo que parecía la puerta forzada y el marco un poco descacarillado, así que no nos dio ninguna confianza y bajamos a pedir un cambio, que por suerte nos dieron sin problemas. La habitación que nos asignaron de segundas era amplia, con dos camas, televisión y baño. Cuando subimos en el pasillo había un montón de camas plegadas por allí en medio, parecía que lo estaban desmantelando, y no se veía a nadie por allí que estuviera moviéndolas.A mí personalmente no me gustó el hotel porque me hacía sentir incómoda, me daba la sensación de que estábamos solos en un hotel con pasillos interminables tipo El Resplandor y después de ver la puerta de la primera habitación forzada, menos aún.Luego resultó que en la planta baja había alguna especie de excursión de estudiantes y eso me hice sentir más tranquila. El desayuno era bastante completo, se hacía en el restaurante que está en Hotel Court Safari, que por cierto, la información sobre horarios de comida que había en la habitación estaba equivocada porque cuando bajamos a cenar confiando en ese horario, resultó que el restaurante ya estaba cerrado.Un detalle que no me gustó tampoco es que el día que llegamos siendo ya mediodía, fuimos a comer algo al restaurante y no sé si es porque había un congreso, pero parecía que no querían vernos por allí y nos dieron una mesa en la terraza. Hubiéramos estado bien con vistas a la piscina y los jardines (zonas donde los huéspedes del Hotel Safari no pueden acceder) si no fuera porque había un viento terrible y no fueron capaces de decirnos si queríamos entrar pese a ello.En definitiva, no me gustó nada este hotel, me pareció descuidado y desangelado.","Date of stay: October 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Not a good experience!","We arrived at about 10am, were told check in time is at 2 pm. So stayed in lobby. Not even a cup of water was offered to us!2.15 rooms not ready yet, why, cleaners haven’t finished. 2.30 still not ready, where are our room? Not clear as reception doesn’t have the list!Finally at 2.45 when a few of us start complaining, a manager comes and upgrades us to Safari Court hotel! But day after they ask me new price of court that I had to remember which manager upgraded for us, looking for her name had to discuss with a few managers to fix the issue! Anyway I lost lots of time meeting a few managers!!!!!!Stress!!!!Safari court was a nice hotel I will review in their page.","Date of stay: September 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Buena opción","Estuvimos alojados una noche. La habitación es espaciosa y còmoda y el baño limpio con una ducha que funcionaba un poco floja pero a nosotros a nos va bien. El personal es amable y los salones para eventos son amplios. Comparte complejo con el hotel Safari Court de más categoria. La piscina estaba cerrada por lo que nos enviaron a la del Hotel Safarii Court. el desayuno abundante y bueno. Solo podría como pero que està alejado del centro de Windoek y que el wifi era flojo.","Date of stay: August 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Overpriced for average room","I booked a standard room and received a room absolutely below standard. The bedside lamps did not work, the refrigerator door did not close and the TV remote did not have any batteries. I didn't inspect any further, instead headed to the reception to ask for another room. They were kind enough to upgrade me to a business room. The room itself was OK I guess. Dark but clean and more spacious. Unfortunately I couldn't watch tv at night as it made a horrible screeching noise. On my first night my neighbours were watching TV so loudly o could listen in on every word. In the morning I was rudely awoken by staff chatting outside my window at 7am. Breakfast was nothing special. On the second evening one of the light bulbs exploded. I called reception and explained what happened and asked for assistance in cleaning the glass pieces. Some 20minutes later housekeeping appeared and then left again because they had nothing to clean up the glass. For the rest of my stay I couldn't walk barefoot because there were glass pieces all over the floor. The internet is also terrible, it asked me to log in every other minute. For the price I paid it was unacceptable. There are much better alternative establishments!","Date of stay: April 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Friendly Hotel but a bit tired","A small group of us stayed at the Safari Hotel en route to and from Johannesburg visiting Namibia. As is almost universally true in Southern Africa the people are most friendly and anxious to please. However, it is in need of some tender loving care as the rooms, although comfortable, had small things needing repair - like no basin plugs or broken toilet seats. The food was OK. We did not know the actual price as it was part of a tour. However, it was not ideally placed for transiting as it is not in town and rather  a long way from the airport.","Date of stay: September 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Cheap and cheerful","We stayed here one night after trekking across from Zimbabwe. It is a very large complex comprising two hotels the Safari and Safari Lodge. We stayed in the former, older hotel. The rooms are a bit basic and the TV's are bit aged but it's perfectly comfortable for the odd night. The wi-if is erratic and did not work at all on our final morning. The food was good. We had an excellent buffet for dinner and the breakfast. buffet was also very good.","Date of stay: June 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ok rooom, average (boring?) food, poor wifi","The room was ok (it was rather clean) but a tad too old. When it comes to the bathroom, it needs more cleaning (I found hair in the shower when I arrived). Also... the rooms are a bit ""far"" from the reception (approx. 5 minute walk), so it might be tricky if you travel with a lot of heavy suitcases. My room was too far from the main building to have wifi, so I had to go the reception or the swimming pool to have access to it (which was quite annoying).The food is boring and the service is really poor (I had to wait for more than 30 minutes to order my food a couple of times). The waiters are doing their best but they are clearly understaffed! The breakfast buffet is fine but again, it was quite a hassle to get tea as the waiters pour it for you (and since they're understaffed...). The swimming pool is ok, rather clean. Please note that the hotel is not in the city centre. So you need a cab to get there. The hotel offers a free shuttle service (twice an hour)... which stops at 2 pm on Saturdays!!!","Date of stay: October 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Safari Hotel - Windhoek","Sometimes in life you discover a gem and need to share it with friends or fellow travellers. Well, the Safari Hotel in Windhoek is a Gem!We travelled from Swakopmund to Windhoek on gravel roads with our BMW 1200 Adventure motorcycles. This trip took most of the day as it is a tough route through various mountain passes. So by the time we arrived in Windhoek, we were tired, thirsty, hungry and in need of a shower, not to mention a decent room for the stopover.From the moment we rode into the magnificent complex, we were wowed! The security guard waved us in and saluted the men on their machines, welcoming us!The team at reception wasted no time is suggesting that we book two chalets for the night so that we can park our motorcycles under the carports right adjacent to our front door! The rates were reasonable at about NS 850/night/chalet. Checking in took 5 minutes, whilst we were ordering cold beers from the bar next door.Hotel complex consist of two hotels as well as chalet complex, all well maintained and spacious surrounds. Great breakfast by the way also included in our rate.Overall, a great experience and certainly staff that understands how to look after their customers. Management must take a compliment as well.Kind Regards Eugene","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comfortable but a little out-dated","This hotel is perfectly suitable for business people staying in Windhoek. It has everything you could need, bar, restaurant, wifi, comfortable rooms, transport, gym, etc. In general, the rooms are a little outdated and we had an issue as we were three, they put us in a room for two, but they were also kind enough to upgrade us to a room for four. Our breakfast was included, nice, no complaints. The fitness centre & spa was amazing! State of the art, brand new equipment and very professional staff - make sure to book for spa treatments. The staff were very friendly and helpful with finding safe transport to and from our dinner reservations. Would recommend to people staying in Windhoek on work/business trips or one-nighters.","Date of stay: July 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Comfortable but could be improved","I stayed at this hotel while attending a mini-conference at the hotel.  The rooms were comfortable although they were a little old fashioned.  The cleaners also kept leaving windows open and then rain poured in as there were thunderstorms every afternoon.  The air conditioners were old and noisy so could not really be used.  The TV was very small and I did not get a good signal most of the time.Internet access was my biggest issue - I just could not connect in the rooms although they say one should be able to.  The only time I got access was in the conference room itself and, even then, we battled to get the password.The food was quite good, although we only ate lunch and breakfast.","Date of stay: March 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Decent but the food leaves a bad taste in the mouth","I stayed for 3 nights at Hotel Safari as part of a business trip. The hotel is generally clean and well taken care of with very spacious rooms, the one thing that seems to stick out is the food. The breakfast buffet is messy and looks like it was hashed up in an army canteen, with a per night rate of about $110 you'd expect a decent breakfast. Another thing I also noticed was that none of the rooms were for non-smokers, the corridors always had a pungent smell of cigarettes.","Date of stay: September 2010This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Etwas abseits, sonst ok","Etwas außerhalb des Stadtzentrums gelegen, so dass man immer mit dem Taxi bzw. mit dem angebotenen Shuttleservice in die Stadt fahren muss. In der direkten Umgebung ist nicht viel los. Auf dem Hotelarenal sind mehrere Hotels untergebracht (3 und 4 Sterne Hotel). Zu Beginn unserer Reise durch das südliche Afrika haben wir im 3 sterne Hotel eine Nacht verbracht. Das Gelände ist weitläufig und so war es von der Rezeption zum Zimmer schon ein gutes Stück zu Fuß (etwa 5 Minuten). Das Zimmer selbst war nichts besonderes, aber sauber und komplett eingerichtet. gut gefallen hat uns der Poolbereich mit vielen Liegen. Das frühstück war recht englisch geprägt und nichts besonderes (Cornflakes und Toast gab es jedoch auch). Insgesamt für eine Nacht ganz ok, wenn man vorher aber in einer individuellen Lodge übernachtet hat sollte man nicht viel erwarten.","Date of stay: September 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Ok, aber das Personal könnte motivierter sein","Das Hotel liegt etwa 45min mit dem Auto vom International Airport Windhoek entfernt und eher außerhalb des Stadtzentrums. Zu Fuß waren wir vom Hotel ins Stadtzentrum etwa 40min unterwegs.Die Anlage ist sehr groß und verfügt über ausreichend Parkplätze für Selbstfahrer.An der Hotelrezeption wurden wir freundlich begrüßt, jedoch wirkte das Hotelpersonal eher unmotiviert und träge.Die Zimmer waren sauber und ok, aber in die Jahre gekommen. Jedoch lief der Abfluss unserer Dusche und des Waschbeckens sehr langsam, müsste also mal wieder gereinigt werden. Ein Kühlschrank war vorhanden, dieser funktionierte aber auch nach dem drücken verschiedener Knöpfe und Stromschalter nicht. Nach unserer ersten Nacht funktionierte im ganzen Resort das Wasser nicht mehr. Wir sind also ohne Duschen ins Stadtzentrum zum Abendessen gefahren. Als wir wieder zurückkamen, stand unser ganzer Zimmerfußboden unter Wasser. Die Hotelrezeption reagierte schnell und gab uns ein neues Zimmer.Das Frühstück war ok und auch die Auswahl war soweit in Ordnung (frische Omeletts, süße Backwaren, verschiedene Aufschnitte, Eierspeisen, Porridge, Obst, warme Anteile wie Speck, Bohnen und Würstchen). Der Frühstücksraum war aber sehr kalt und auch eher spärlich besucht, also nach Hauptreisesaison sah das nicht aus. Wer einfache Ansprüche zum Übernachten hat, so wie wir, für den ist das Hotel Safari absolut ausreichend. Ein ATM ist im übrigen in der Hotellobby vorhanden.Punktabzug gab es für das unmotivierte Personal, die abgelebte Einrichtung und die eisigen Temperaturen im Frühstücksbereich.","Date of stay: July 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Worst stay ever","I stayed there for 7 days over a two week period. 3 days one week, 4 days next. Firstly their rates changed when I tried to book the accommodation for the second week. Price changes by N$210 per night. When I pointed out that it will be from the same type of room I was fobbed off. The air-conditioner in the room makes a terrible noise , so you cannot run it at night during sleep time. The tv channels are very badly tunned-in and you cannot see the picture . The telephone in my room was not working and they never bothered to fix it. I had to call via cell to their switchboard to get any service. They want to save water but their toilets were constantly running water into the bowl, and not just a drip!! I could not use the wifi as the room is in a corner and there is no coverage.","Date of stay: October 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Schöne Bilder - die aber täuschen","Entschuldigung, ich muss zu dieser Unterkunft mal schreiben.Wir waren auf Rundreise und im März hier untergebracht. Es war eine glatte Katastophe. Das Zimmer zwar groß, aber schmutzig, als wäre hier lange keiner gewesen - weder Gast noch Putzfrau. Hotelservice angerufen, es kam auch einer, der die Überdecke mitnahm, weil sie zwei große Pissflecken zeigte, was für eine Sauerei. Die Putzfrau kam wenig später und saugte die Bettvorleger, weil da Haare und andere Krümel drauflagen und säuberte den mit Schimmel besetzten Kühglschrank und die Flecken und Fettreste vom kleinen Glastisch. Furchtbar. Nach dieser Erfahrung  auch in Zimmern der Mitreisenden, besuchte keiner das Restaurant; alle aßen auswärts.Deshalb schwierig das Personal zu bewerten. Zum Glück waren wir nur eine Nacht in diesem Hotel.

I will start with the serving staff who are unfriendly, chew gum while serving u and are on their cell phones constantly while one wait on service.

"Could do better","Standard rooms, as opposed to the business class, have very basic, old fashioned furniture and the noise from the adjoining bathrooms is terrible. Also if you are on the ground floor the noise of cars arriving and leaving, there is motel type parking, is bad in the evening and early morning.There is an annoying internet system that only allows you to sign in for 2 hours at a time.

"Ottimo hotel completo di ogni servizio, vicino al centro città","Ho soggiornato in questa location per 1 notte in tour Nomad come tappa finale prima di andare in aeroporto. Il complesso è molto grande, ma ben strutturato e organizzato. All’arrivo ci hanno accolti con un piccolo aperitivo,  consegnato le chiavi delle camere e portato le valige direttamente alla camera (facchini). Nella hall c’è il wifi free funzionante (anche nell’intero complesso/stanze ma il segnale è molto debole), un bar, la sala ristorante e la sala colazioni. Nella hall c’è anche un piccolo bancomat per poter prelevare contante in caso servisse. La camera assegnata era molto spaziosa, dotata di 2 letti e un divano, tv, frigobar e bagno. Il bagno era molto pulito, con doccia. All’interno di questo hotel, vi è anche un piccolo giardino con piscina, dove potersi rilassare un po dopo una giornata calda. La colazione l’ho trovata ottima, è a buffet, ottima la varietà di dolci e di salato da poter scegliere, inoltre si può effettuare richieste direttamente al cuoco. In conclusione, in questo posto mi sono trovato bene sia per l’accoglienza, sia per la posizione, sia per il livello generale dell’hotel.","Date of stay: December 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Für eine Nacht ok","Das Safari Hotel war die erste Unterkunft in Namibia, bevor wir zur den Lodges fuhren. Das Gelände ist weitläufig, hat aber auf den ersten Blick weit bessere Zeiten gesehen, das Personal (bis auf den Concierge an der Rezeption) sehr nett und zuvorkommend. Ein bisschen gruselig war es für uns, da wir gleich nach der Ankunft gebrieft wurden (nicht in der Nacht unterwegs sein, außer mit einem ordentlichen Taxi...), unsere Hotelzimmertüre zwar geschlossen hat, aber es war ein mehr als fingerdicker Spalt zwischen dem Rahmen und der Türe (dafür alle Fenster mit massiven Gittern verhangen?!). Das Badezimmer war geräumig, man könnte ev. die Duschköpfe regelmäßig entkalken, dann hätten wir nicht den kompletten Raum unter Wasser gesetzt. ;) Wir haben am Ankunftstag im Hotel gegessen, leider waren weder die Chicken wings (deren Fleisch war fast schwarz?), noch der Backfisch wirklich genießbar. Das Frühstücksbuffet war hingegen wirklich umfangreich und ganz frisch. Wir haben eine weitere Nacht dort verbracht (Abreise), beim neu zugewiesenen Zimmer war zwar kein Spalt bei der Türe, allerdings war die Badezimmer- und Duschtüre so eigenartig zueinander angebracht, dass wir Schwierigkeiten hatten die Türen wieder zu entkeilen. Für die An- und Abreise ist es ok, mehr als das ist nicht zu empfehlen.","Date of stay: September 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

With additional rooms for break away sessions, this hotel is ideal to host big Government conferences and product launches. Their accommodation is also excellent and even better for the logistics and planning team.","Date of stay: October 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very disappointing","The reception area is very lavish,however the rooms are in a very poor condition. Security in the area is seriously compromised I woke up one morning to find all four hubcaps of my rental vehicle stolen in the parking area. Upon reporting the matter to hotel management the response was that my vehicle's hubcaps going missing is still nothing because crime is the norm in the area because using the parking is at own risk with no CCTV cameras present or even guards patrolling the area.","Date of stay: July 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nichts besonderes, für Windhoek ok!","Das Hotel ist sehr unpersönlich, da sehr viele Zimmer vorhanden sind. Die Zimmer waren sauber und mit einem Kühlschrank und Pflegeprodukte ausgestattet. Es ist jedoch recht dunkel in dem Zimmer.Direkt neben dem Hotel liegt ein regionaler Flughafen, deshalb ist es zeitweise sehr laut.Das Frühstück war reichlich und auch lecker. Der Personal im Frühstücksraum jedoch unfreundlich.WLAN-Codes mit 500 MB sind gegen Gebühr erhältlich.Der Pool sah nicht sauber aus und lädt nicht zum Schwimmen ein. Außerdem lebt im Pool eine Wasserschildkröte, wer also Schwimmen möchte, bitte vorsichtig sein :-)Es wird ein kostenloser Shuttle in die Stadt angeboten, der relativ pünktlich ist.","Date of stay: March 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Praktisch für die erste / letzte Nacht in Namibia und um Windhoek zu entdecken.","Zimmer ein wenig in die Jahre gekommen, aber sauber und geräumig. Ein Shuttlebus in die Stadt wird kostenfrei angeboten. Kleine Poolanlage um sich nach dem Besuch in der Stadt zu erfrischen. Das Frühstück war sowohl von der Auswahl, als auch von der Qualität okay.

"VERY DISAPPOINTING, DIRTY AND POOR SERVICE","-When checking in front desk staff spoke in Africans the entire time.-Names couldnt be found but eventually they were found.-My room was changed 3 times, the first room was dirty, had dead insects and was very dusty, second rooms was already booked so they transfered us to another room which had very poor internet connection but we just had to settle because we were tired of moving up and down, porters didnt even bother to assist with bags.-Very average breakfast, no effort whatsoever to make it tasty.-Cracked Coffee mug at the breakfast table.-Least favourite hotel I have been to thus far.-Stains on sheets","Date of stay: June 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good hotel, quite centrally located","We got a big family room with four beds next to each other, fridge and air conditioner. We got a welcome drink and had complimentary water in the room. TV (working badly), free wifi, which worked in the room, laundry service. Pool, free pool towels and plenty of sun deck chairs. Kids were very happy. Would have liked to spend more than one night and visit Windhoek and relax/unwind here instead of traveling to the Okavango Delta the next day. We had dinner at the restaurant of the Safari Court and breakfast at the Safari Hotel. The dinner was a lovely buffet for 290 Namibian dollars, including dessert. The breakfast buffet is great with a lot of variety, including crêpes, pancakes, cereal, bread and rolls, hot dishes, fruit salad and much more.","Date of stay: November 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The 4 star Safari court is much better (rooms, food) but the 3-star Safari hotel is alright but not as comfortable as the 4 star one.Very busy hotel.

"Non convince","Sono stata in questo hotel due notti, non consecutive, all'inizio e alla fine del tour in Namibia. Le camere sono spaziose e letti quasi queen size. Ci hanno messo nella struttura con ""suite"" alle spalle dell'entrata dell'hotel. Le stanze non sono molto isolate fra loro. Il bagno, in entrambi i casi, di dimensioni ridotte e con qualche problema per la poca manutenzione. Impossibile capire il funzionamento della doccia: o si gela o ci si scotta. Abbiamo provato anche il buffet della cena: non male; alza il punteggio della recensione.Il personale è cordiale, ma non sempre veloce nel risolvere i problemi (ho aspettato per quasi un giorno una saponetta per il bagno, che alla fine non è arrivata).Hanno un servizio navetta compreso per raggiungere il centro città e i due centri commerciali più grandi di Windhoek.Il wifi funziona bene nella hall, mentre, come spesso accade, nelle stanze è lento e spesso la copertura se ne va.","Date of stay: August 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Rude staffs","I booked my air ticket and hotel accommodation on Orbitz.com and had a selection of rooms at this facility. I chose a Business room with one double bed. Upon arrival, I was offered a twin bed room. I approached the duty manager for the mix-up and he was not only rude but accused Orbitz of advertising what the hotel does not offer.Despite the fact I showed the gentleman the booking confirmation he still insisted that the agent had WRONG pictures of rooms on the website.","Date of stay: May 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Простой, но вполне приличный  отель за небольшие деньги.","Отель не новый, но в  номерах есть всё необходимое, для того, чтобы отдохнуть после длительного перелёта, они  простенькие, чистенькие  и достаточно просторные.  Можно  освежиться в бассейне, он, можно сказать, большой, но вода в апреле немного бодрит и с хлоркой, по-моему, перестарались. Есть возможность отдохнуть в шезлонгах на поляне перед бассейном, там же есть бар на свежем воздухе. Приятно удивил завтрак.

"Staff need some hospitality training","Booked at the last minute, reception staff were pleasant apart from one young lady, who twice put the phone down on someone in a rude manner.  The rooms look jaded but worked.  The food at the Bar Terrace, was very nice and good value for money, pity the waiter who served us both nights was on a different planet, and had the same stained clothing on as the night previous.  Service is slow, 45 minutes to get an Irish Coffee, ordered whilst we still had our main course plates in front of us, is just a little too long to wait......... But there were two other tables of, two and five people that might have been the hold up.  Management should check their staff occasionally and not just rely on conferences to keep them ticking over.","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Decent Place, No Great Shakes but perfectly Okay","Okay, well the first thing i have to say is that Windhoek must have some pretty good hotels...at the time of writing this hotel was ranked 17 out or 17 hotels in town.Now if I read that before my trip i would have been quaking in my boots coming to stay here as part of my G Adventure. It is by no means a plush pad but my God, it does not deserve to be ranked as the worst hotel in the city!The rooms are a bit tired and drab, but they were clean and spacious. The hotel pool was really nice and the breakfast was absolutely excellent. The staff were so helpful and the wifi was both free and quick. They have a god business centre which was free of charge and they offer a free shuttle to downtown Windhoek.As long as you do not expect too much, the Safari will do you just fine, I simply cannot believe its poor ranking. i would have no problem whatsoever in staying here again and have no problem in recommending this place.","Date of stay: July 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very average","I have stayed twice for several days in the last year. The first time was in the motel style rooms, which were pretty much tatty 70's vintage decor (no, not by design, the real thing!). This time I booked into the business rooms and found the rooms again to be below par. Forget sleeping with the aircon on, it sounds like a bulldozer idling outside your window....and in 40 degree celcius temperatures, an aircon might be useful. The internet didn't work in the rooms (try 8 minutes to open an email without attachments), the toilet pipe leaked on the bathroom floor and the coffee is positively insipid. That said, it is convenient, but there are many bnb's in town which are a far better quality stay... for the same money -  try the Elegant Guesthouse or the Olive Grove, both great places to stay.","Date of stay: February 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Nice place but far from the city","I was travelling for business and the hotel was selected by my hosts (corporate rate 622 N$ for single occupancy). My first impression was not good, it looks rather old fashioned and worn, but after a few days, I came to appreciate the cosiness of it all.Rooms are spacious with large bathroom (shower only), all kept very clean, but also somewhat worn out. Old TV-set with some channels in poor quality (there are many channels, so you can always find something), phone with loose wires and a Wifi that does not work in the far away rooms (like no. 19). Btw. to get wifi you must obtain a license key in reception, which will give you 2 hours of connection. Free service, but somewhat cumbersome.The kitchen will serve you round the clock, with buffets in the morning and evenings (for evenings you change to a la carte after one trial of the buffet). Prices are fair (but high when compared to Windhoek restaurants). Nice pool area, garden, kids playground and terrace. And the beer is nice (try Windhoek Lager).Drawback is the location next to the old Windhoek Airport, and hence 5 km from the city centre. A free shuttle will take you there in daytime (and to a local shopping mall), so will cabs, but it is outside the city itself.All in all a nice stay for one week, with helpful staff and reasonable setting. Next time I will ask for something closer to the city though.","Date of stay: June 2010This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A Good choice for business trip to Windhoek","Stayed in a business room for 3 nights. Room was large and clean with a good size bathroom with bath. Generally everything of a good standard, although there was rip in the net curtains, a broken bin lid and the large key ring and stiff lock made getting into the room a bit of a noisy struggle.Bought internet cards from reception which worked in the room, although fairly slow and did not always log off correctly wasting paid minutes.Reasonable pool, but water heavy with chemical and no shade for the loungers, although there are tables and chairs under thatched open-sided “huts”.Staff friendly and very helpful, but generally slower waiter service than in the US or Europe.Breakfast buffet style with reasonable hot choice, but no fresh fruit and limited selection of cold meats and cheese.Taxis easily arranged by reception into town.","Date of stay: November 2008This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappointed - Not a suitable hotel to work from","I emailed to book into the Safari Court - I only received a response after 5 days and by that time I had booked with my second choice Safari Hotel.  How disappointing this was ..I expected more for N$921.00 per night.  My room (115) was big, dark and cold feeling.  The very small TV did not have a Europian News channel and programs were limited.  Internet was extremely limited - I was given a token for a specific amount of data which did not last long.On the plus side the breakfast was very good - even though the staff had cleared away before I had finished!  Another plus was the free shuttle service to Eros airport.","Date of stay: July 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Our nightmare experience","Safari Hotel In Windhoek used to be a good hotel but something terrible has happened to the hotel- poor management. The service of the hotel has dropped and it was a night mare upon our arrival to sort out our room reservations which where done four months prior to arrival and the hotel was contact three times on the day of arrivL but still they could not get things right. It took an hour to sort out the messy and we went to sleep in the early hours of the day of arrival. The rooms are not thoroughly cleaned. The TV sets in the room are from the dark ages . The facility is big, the place looks well at a glance but something seriously is wrong with the way the hotel is being managed. The level of poor service is pathetic.","Date of stay: December 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First, but not last, trip to Africa","We stayed at the Safari for a bit over two weeks on a combination business and sightseeing trip.  First off, it should be made clear that there are two separate hotels on this property, the Safari and the Safari Court.  We stayed at the Safari, an older, bigger facility.  The Safari Court is a much newer hotel.  There is a large conference center served by both hotels.  Our room, in the Safari, was quite large by today's standards with a refrigerator, TV, and the usual hot water pot and coffee makings.  The air conditioning was more than adequate.  The room was provided with a small, west facing balcony that looked onto a small citrus grove.  It was classified as a business room.While this hotel is an older property, we were very comfortable.  The room service was prompt, friendly and helpful.  The hotel provide shuttle was convenient and runs all day.  The driver was able to accommodate our requests for short side trips.  One afternoon, there were some significant issues with the water supply but those issues were quickly resolved.  There is also, occasionally, significant noise from the nearby airport.  I would stress to anyone planning a visit to Namibia anticipating staying at this property:  THIS IS NOT YOUR GRANDFATHER'S HILTON!.  It is a comfortable, somewhat rustic, more than suitable base for touring the area of central and coastal Namibia.  It is NOT a resort hotel.  The food is reasonably good with an extensive, somewhat regionalized menu and the Welwitschia Restaurant was uniformly good.  Service, without exception, was outstanding.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we will visit again and we will stay at this property.  Namibia is a fascinating country; Africa as were want to remember it from our childhood stories.  To have recovered from the conflicts of only 25 years ago is remarkable and the government of Namibia is to be congratulated for they have accomplished.","Date of stay: November 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Koffer an die Türen stellen muss damit man in der Nacht ruhig schlafen kann. Im Bad war das WC-Becken undicht und das Waschbecken verstopft, so das Hände waschen und Zähneputzen nur in der Dusche möglich war.Die Zimmerausstattung war stark abgewohnt, besonders im Sanitärbereich.  Der Balkon war voller Zigarettenkippen. Wir hatten den Eindruck, dass die Zimmer nicht gereinigt waren. Sonst hätte die gebrauchte Seife der Vorgänger im Bad, das verstopfte Waschbecken und die Kippen auffallen müssen.  Der Fußboden war schmutzig,  Auch der Zugangsbereich zu den Zimmern war längere Zeit nicht gereinigt worden (sehr schmutzig).","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Location required a ride to get downtown Windhoek.","Date of stay: March 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Functional but in need of improvements","IMPORTANT  TO KNOW:  the ""Safari Hotel"" (three stars), the ""Safari Court"" (four stars), and the ""Safari Conference Center"" are all located next to each other in the same property and have access to pretty much the same restaurants and services.  This means that choosing between the two hotels is an issue of how much you want to pay for your room.  LOCATION: The facilities are right next to the old airport, which I think now serves as the poinf of departure for the domestic flights (absolutely no noise in case you wonder).  The international airport is about 45 minutes away from the Hotel and Windhoek.  Coming back to the hotel, it is in the outskirts of Windhoek, but it is a small city and they do have a free shuttle that goes down town and to a shopping center.   Windhoek itself is pretty organized and clean, a fact that took me by surprise.   If you take a taxi, make sure to ask what the total fare is BEFORE departing (I took a hotel taxi with three people; the driver said it was NAD 50 for the ride, but then claimed at the end that it was NAD 50 per person!  We refused to pay him ).   THE ROOM:  I staid in the executive rooms of the Safari Hotel (three stars) which was perfectly clean, but it did feel a bit tired (e.g. the toilet lid had lost a bit of paint).  On the other hand, hotel is safe and the room will accomodate you well.  I read a review saying there were no elevators, but there were two of them in my area.  Another review spoke about cigarrette smell.  I am quite sensitive to it, but I don't think it would be a problem for most (they seemed to ventilate all rooms everyday).  I do not know if the situation is different in other parts of the hotel.Four things I would suggest the management to fix or improve are:  1) the minibar fridge is old, which means it's a bit noisy.  I am not particularly sensitive to noise, but I am sure this would probably be a problem for some.  2) the rooms lack a safe box.  They have a centralized safe in the reception, but it's not convenient at all to be going back and forth to get  them if you constantly need them (i.e. a laptop!) 3) The rooms also lack an ironing board, which means you depend on the hotel for pressing.  This is probably not an issue if you go on holidays, but if you are there for business it's not nice to have to guess whether your shirt will be ready on time for the next day's meeting.4) the key chain they give you can only be described as the biggest key chain in the world!  It's a huge piece of plastic that is about a third of a letter size page.  Where are you supposed to keep it?FOOD:  It's pretty standard and on the expensive side.  Other reviewers considered it was ""terrible"", but I did not find that to be the case.  On the other hand, if you want a fancy dinner then better go to a restaurant in Windhoek (Joe's Beer House is a fantastic experience!).  The breakfast buffet was also standard, but lacked fruit.","Date of stay: August 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hotel needs modernization","Firstly I booked for 3 nights only to be told on arrival that I was booked for one night. Although I eventually got sorted I was in panic mode that first night. The old  couch in my room was visibly dusty. I think it actually requires replacement. One of the towels had a browner shade of white...meaning it was either dirty, not properly washed or it was just old. You could just tell the difference in whiteness with the other towels. Wifi was just a disaster. I observed the hotel must have been hosting at least 3 conferences at one go...I think this seriously compromised service. Anyone willing to see those old small television set with that back and no flat screen???? This is the place. I bet they keep those as antiques otherwise hotel must just upgrade furniture. I guess that what value for money means because to their credit, their rates are very low.","Date of stay: October 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Good accommodation choice in Windhoek","Hotel staff meet you on arrival at the local or international airport. Hotel has all amenities and rooms are spacious and comfortable.  Dining room offers choice of buffet or a la carte menu. We sampled each option, and the a la carte menu is interesting and the food beautifully prepared and served ( except desert - mediocre!). Staff are helpful, and nothing is a trouble: staff members go out of their way to help.Shuttle bus runs on the hour to CBD and other shopping malls.Air Con is set at 20 degrees C, which is too warm overnight; however, we opened the window for fresh air.

"Good enough!","The hotel seems abuzz with activity upon arrival. Reception wasnt sure that our rooms were ready and this was at 4:30. The hotel system seems to be manual which seems strange for such a large establishment. The room, bathroom and bedding was clean but it was very apparent that room cleaners are not supervised. The duvet cover opening was at the top of the bed and open, which could be staff inexperience but should have been picked up by the supervisor, so I can only conclude that there is no supervision. The breakfast the next morning was fair, but all self service except for tea and coffee.","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Namibia value","I travelled to Windhoek for the presentation of a technical workshop. My wife and I stayed at the Safari Hotel, a stray which we really did enjoy. Apart from a minor glitch where we had no hot water  as a result of a burst geyser, the occasion was memorable in many respects. The staff were both friendly and professional. The food was first class, the room very spacious and comfortable. All in all really good value for money and our stay will long be remembered. Even the conference facilities were thoughtfully appointed and professionally serviced.

"Average. Nothing more","Just returned from a business trip to Windhoek and stayed 1 night here.  This hotel sus up to an average hotel thats fine for not more than 1 night.Rooms are large, though deco is out dated and shows the wear and tear.The visiting cockroach and ants made me question the cleanliness. Bed is comfortable with comfotable bedding, however my sleep was seriously disrupted by the extremely noisy air-conditioner. After been forced to switch it off, the room them became unbearably hot. No fault of the hotel, but it rained that night so leaving the window open was not practical. This is where my stay just became unpleasant. Breakfast has a good selection.Gym in the Safari Court Hotel is relatively good, though there are no towels and the rowing machines did not work.The price at this hotel is competative, so if you are on a budget and need to spend a night in Windhoek, this would suffice,","Date of stay: January 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

My stay in namibia was great and all the accommodation clean and above expectation but this hotel and the price I paid was like a slum.

"Budget Hotel -- Don't expect more","Located in an odd corner of town, convenient to Eros Airport but not much else, this is the older, uglier sister to the neighboring Safari Court Conference Hotel, which charges more and offers more.Internet, for instance.  There is no internet service or wireless option in the Safari rooms.  You have to buy a voucher and go to the Safari Court business center.  If you don't plan to spend much time in your room, or eat any fresh fruit or healthy bread for breakfast, this is an adequate place to stay.    Given the usual standard of Namibian and southern African hospitality, however, the Safari was a reasonably-priced, but characterless disappointment.","Date of stay: July 2008This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Business Class - not Budget","Do not book a budget room, because many of them are not renovated and extremely filthy and worn-out. We stayed first three nights in budget room number 73 that was ""average"", but next time when we returned back from safari we were given the room number 14, that was under all standards (also the African standards). So we changed up to business. These rooms are clean and the difference in price is very small. The hotel is located some kilometers away, but the free transportation is effective and runs until 9 PM. There is nothing to complain about breakfast or pool-area. The staff is friendly and plentiful, but the service is African standard (slow). And if you come from euro-area, the prices are very cheap.","Date of stay: January 2008This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Bad food, ok rooms, good public spaces","We stayed here for a conference for a couple of days.Let's start with the good things: The hotel has a big and clean pool with a nice garden.The rooms however are old and need to be renovated, including furniture and the bathrooms.The worst part about it: The food and the waiters. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel and got tired of it after one day. The waiters are unmotivated and untrained. Even though service seems to be a general problem in Namibia, this place was the worst. Workers didn't bother to even approach tables of guests, got orders wrong and took ages to bring the drinks. Luckily, the food was buffet but the quality of the food was fairly low.If you have the choice, make sure you stay in the 4*-hotel on the same plot.","Date of stay: March 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Great Structural and architectural piece but...","Beautiful place however the services do not match the rating. My impression was that the hotel can be rated higher than 4-star If the standard of services was raised. For  examples, getting meals after an order takes too much time and the team at the reception seem to have too much to do. At times they left clients waiting unattended to at the counter while doing something else. They seemed overloaded with responsibilities and assignments. Management should look at how best this can be improved.","Date of stay: April 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Excellent Accomodations & Excellent Price!","We traveled to Namibia in Sept. 2013 and I was nervous about accomodations....not knowing if standards would be the same. The Safari Hotel was excellent. Very clean and just like anything you would walk in to in the United States. The rooms were typical for a Hilton, Marriott type hotel and the staff was very helpful. We had a wonderful breakfast in the restaurant downstairs with many offerings from pastries, to hot items, to cereal and fruit.  We did not use the pool area as we just stayed over one night on our way elsewhere, but it looked fantastic. The grounds were nicely kept and there was ample parking.","Date of stay: October 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"No way Dude.","Safari hotel and Safari Court Hotel are two sister hotels on the same property.Originally booked in at the safari hotel, just one look at the room and one wiff of the smell changed my mind. it said 3 star but looked like a 1 star. the reception area was good and the pool was great and thats where it all endsI believe it has a great conferance facility but I did not hang around to find outThe pictures on the web where very miss-leading but seeing as I had no where else to go I booked in to the safari court hotel insteadNought said..........","Date of stay: April 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Fine for a night or two","There's nothing really wrong with the Safari - the rooms are a good size, reasonably comfortable and clean. However, it's not really somewhere that you would want to spend any more than a night or two - it just lacks any character.","Date of stay: October 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Der absoulte Top Urlaub","Das Camp ist hervorragend, die achteckigen Zelte sind bestens ausgestattet. Hier gibt es einen fest gemauerten Waschtisch und gemauerte und getrennte DU und WC. Steckdosen, Schreibtisch, Moskitonetz, Terasse mit 2 Stühlen und Öllampe. Im Zelt gibt es eine Taschenlampe (da ab ca. 23. 00 Uhr-05. 00 Uhr kein Strom!) und eine Trillerpfeife für Notfälle. Außerdem gibt es einen Klingelknopf, damit man bei Dunkelheit und für Gepäckservice einen Massai rufen kann, dieser bringt die Gäste sicher zum Hauptgebäude. Das Camp ist unter deutscher Leitung, der Service ist super. Das Restaurant bot abends ein 4Gang Wahlmenue von sehr guter Qualität, das Frühstücksbuffet war umfangreich und ebenfalls sehr gut. Es gibt auch richtige Zimmer in Bungalows und neuerdings einen Pool mit Wellnessbereich. All dies ist direkt in der Wildnis (Steppe), ohne Zaun direkt neben den Warzenschweinen, Impalas und Erdhörnchen.","This review is the subjective opinion of an individual traveler and not of Tripadvisor LLC nor of its partners.

"A 0-star restaurant in a 4-star Hotel","Please do not waist your time and money to go to the Restaurant of the Safari Hotel in Windhoek.Their waiters are doing their best, but their food is pathetic. They charge you N$130,00 per person for Sunday Lunch Buffet but the food they provide and the choices available is worse than that of a corner cafe take-away.Some of the choices looked (and tasted) like the previous day's left-overs just being heated again - or being being thrown into cup-a-soup and being dished up as stew.There are a lot of excellent restaurants in Windhoek - so, stay away from this rip-off!!!","Date of stay: September 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"stopover in Windhoek","The Safari Hotel can be rated as a 1 star Hotel.  The business room was in a terrible condition.  The curtains were broken.  The shower head was broken and the taps were leaking.  The water trickled out .  The bath was also in a poor condition.  The whole experience was very disappointing indeed.","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Stay away","After staying at over 20 different hotels in Africa, this was truly unacceptable.  Not sure if they gave me this room by mistake or what.  I paid about the same what I had paid for other very nice accomidations during 40 days in Namibia and So. Africa.  This room had a closet door dangling off the ceiling, a torn apart safety lock on the door, stains on furniture , carpet, and walls,  phone wires had been  torn out of  wall,  thick layer of bugs in the bathroom light fixtures, broken tile and on and on.  When the deskstaff was told they acted surprised I did not like the room!!!!  The bed was clean, but I was glad to leave.","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Hotel for Conference","I stayed in this hotel for a few days to attend a conference a few weeks ago in Namibia. The property is actually quite large and the room I checked into was spacious but strangely, with a small bathroom. The decor was unfortunately a bit ran down and dated which is fine with me as the name of the hotel already gave you a sense of what you would get. The issue was that the Wi-Fi access from the room was very unstable and unusable considering that this is suppose to be a business conference hotel. I was jokingly telling the staffs that the Wi-Fi was a bit like the wild mammals, coming at going at their leisure. On the positive side, the restaurant and and drink bar were quite excellent. Serving great testing African and Western food. The spicy buffalo wings is a must try!","Date of stay: May 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Lovely friendly staff","I thoroughly enjoyed my week in the Safari Hotel in Namibia.  All the staff were absolutely great.  The hotel was reasonably quiet as it was mid-winter in Windhoek - although nice and warm during the day.   The conference facilities were fine and all the food as excellent.  Room large and comfortable, albeit quite old fashioned.","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Long term stay","Was recently here for a conference.  If you are staying a long time it might be worth asking for a room upstairs.  Some people complained about cockroaches in the rooms on the ground (and lower) levels.  Internet was good - but 2 hour coupons were a little painful to use.  Breakfast was standard Southern Africa fare.  Bring your own hairdryer, unless you want to count on them having one (they only had 5 for all the rooms).  When they have a big conference they tend to get a little overwhelmed.  Go early for lunch.","Date of stay: June 2012This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"+-2 years of pleasant visits ended today by a “strict” Manager","Today ended somewhat disappointing when we were told that only Hotel Guests may use the pool 🙈, by a “new” manager, assuming also he’s not a Namibian/local. Okay, ...I do agree that Hotel Pools are for guests only, and things can get out of hand when not controlled, but I behave myself, I enjoyed the Island Vacation feeling every time I visited the Hotel pool, I actually made sure about 2 years ago the Reception knew about what my plans were: they accepted and let me feel very welcome.We spent quite a bit on food and drinks next to the pool, regularly, and were given very good service by the very friendly staff. They made us feel welcome.Unfortunately this seemed to be my last visit to the hotel which broke our hearts, as a Manager decided it doesn’t suit!Visiting many Hotels and Guest Houses over a time period of many years, this was the most unwelcome feeling I ever felt. Well, to the staff of the Hotel Safari pool area: thanks for a very good time I had with you guys and girls, thanks for always serving us promptly and for your friendliness, the good food, the beers on hot summer days next to the pool. Thanks also to the staff at reception, all of you made us feel very welcome.Me and my family, and sometimes a friend joining us, will remember this. Unfortunately I cannot say this for the Manager whom I tried to explain this to. Is he Namibian??? He seemed quite irritated, blunt and demanding.I’ll probably never visit, nor propose the Hotel to anyone in future again: where does ons draw the line??? Competition is fierce in this low economic cycle experienced in Namibia: shouldn’t (Namibian) consumers be feeling welcome while spending buckets of money in Namibian Dollars, or are International visitors, with US$, the only focus. Other Namibian Hotels do the contrary! Even at their pool areas.Fortunately I travelled a lot and know what it is to be served and feeling welcome or at home.Therefore the reason for my low rating! The Rest is 4-5 out of 5!!!","Date of stay: December 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Slitet hotell rekommenderas inte","Vi både på hotellet i två olika omgångar och fick problem bägge gånger! Första rummet vi fick där fungerade inte safetyboxen och AC-aggregatet bullrade (AC är från 70-talet). Vi fick då byta till ett annat rum som istället hade en läckande WC anslutning vilket innebar att lite avloppsvatten sipprade ut på golvet i badrummet. Andra gången bodde vi bara en natt och vi fick åter ett rum med bullrande AC (fick stänga aggregatet för att det gick inte att sova på natten). Personalen är nonchalanta. Frukosten är Ok. Rekommenderar inte hotellet! Ligger dessutom inte centralt utan man får ta taxi in till stan. Wi-fi är också mycket svagt på hotellet. Hårda sängar och vi också besök av objudna insekter (läs kackerlackor).","Date of stay: January 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Le safari Court Hotel","Arrivé à Windhoek, le 10/08Salut les amis. Cela fait un long moment que vous n’avez pas de mes nouvelles. Je voyage, mais je n’ai pas eu d’expériences à partager sérieusement avec vous car en famille, on est un peu bridé. Là, je me suis échappé. Je suis à Windhoek, Namibie et au Safari court Hôtel ; il  y a aussi le safari hôtel (la différence ?, j’ai pris de mauvaises habitudes). Peu importe, choisissez ce qui vous convient en fonction de votre budget (les deux Hôtels sont dans la même concession).  J’aime le restaurant du Safari Court. Ses crudités à la plancha m’ont fait adoré le self-service, auquel j’étais allergique (je vous ai dit, j’ai de mauvaises habitudes). En tout état de cause je vous laisse vous balader. La nourriture  souvent à la frenchy et si vous demandez un Chardonay, ne vous y méprenez pas (bien parfumé), il est du voisin Sud-Africain. Ces Français !, il faut qu’ils laissent leurs traces partout…Cet hôtel offre une navette (toutes les heures) à destination des Centres Commerciaux et des places actives en ville (20 minutes avec les feux)Après, je vous parlerai de Okapuka Ranch, où vous pouvez voir les animaux dans leur environnement naturel… A suivre","Date of stay: August 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We were exhausted and only wanted a showr and get to sleep. The rooms were comfortable clean. Hot water was available. In the morning we had a very good breakfast and had recuperate to start to arrange for our traveling.  The rooms just like any other international hotel. The lobby had an African feel to it.

"Gutes Stadthotel","Wir waren zum Anfang unserer Nambia und Botswana Rundreise dort und haben eine Nacht im Hotel verbracht. Die Zimmer sind zweckmäßig und etwas abgewohnt, jedoch sehr sauber. Die Einrichtung ist recht altmodisch. Das Zimmer verfügt über recht gut funktionierendes Wlan und TV mit ZDF-Empfang. Die Nächte werden zu dieser Jahreszeit recht kühl in Namibia und deswegen waren wir sehr froh über eine funktionierende  Heizung. Das Frühstück und das Dinnerbuffet empfanden wir als besonders gut, auch wenn es seinen Preis hat. Das Personal war ausgesprochen freundlich und zuvorkommend. Für eine Nacht können wir dieses Hotel bedenkenlos empfehlen. TIP: Wer das wahre Leben in Windhoek erleben will, bucht eine Stadtrundfahrt bei Face2Face nach Katutura.","Date of stay: July 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Average for Windhoek","My room had a bit of a run-down feel to it, with corners of walls being chipped and needing paint, old carpets, the flower pattern bed spreads were straight from the seventies. The linen on the bed was threadbare with tears in them. The TV - lets move to flat-screen please. Beds were comfortable though and there were more than enough power outlets.Services were not much better.No wi-fi reception in the rooms. No water provided except on day of arrival. Thereafter water would not be replaced in the room. The only option to obtain water is to then purchase a 1 L from the restaurant at N$ 26!Two good aspects were reception staff that were friendly and efficient. The wi-fi was also OK in the restaurant.Meals were a mixed bag. Dinner buffet not too bad, although a bit pricey at N$189. Waiters were very friendly though. Breakfast was just plain poor. I stayed for 5 nights  and not once was I able to get an omelette made. Only once did they manage to make me fresh fried eggs - this was the only morning that the flat-top was actually switched on.(still could not do an omelette though). The rest of the time you only had a choice of pre-cooked scrambled. Breakfast opens at 06:30, but they were never on time.Location I found good, being close to shops, major roads and local airport. Security was also sufficient.In summary - good location, friendly staff. However poor food, wifi in rooms and general outdated feeling brought it down. All in all not terrible, but at the price not good value.","Date of stay: March 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Abbiamo cenato due volte al ristorante dell'hotel il cibo non é male sicuramente la carne é molto buona...la colazione non è male ma ho trovato di meglio altrove...il personale non si sforza più di tanto ad essere simpatico e gentile...insomma se dovete stare una notte va bene ma di più lo sconsiglio!","Date of stay: July 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"only okay!","We had booked for the Safari Court Hotel, but when we arrived we were put into the Safari Hotel (same complex just older and across the car park).  The invoice is misleading as it has both names at the top of the invoice, so just double check and make sure which one you are in.  Our rooms were very very  large, and good enough, but looked like we were checking into a council block.  For some reason they put us right at the end near the staff quarters!!  So perfectly plain and adequate, but it wasnt what I was expecting.   The hotel is large and a bit souless.  Probably just too big and not enough people. During the day we used the pool at the Safari Court Hotel, which is lovely.  The bar however, is better at the Safari Hotel across the car park.  If they could take bits of both hotels and put them together the place would be much better.    My least favourite hotel this holiday to Namibia.","Date of stay: April 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Decent Place to Stay","Like another reviewer mentioned, there are two properties. My review addresses the older, more basic accomodations. I spent two nights here before beginning a trip through Namibia. My biggest complaint about the room is that the A/C [very nice to have] was SO loud that it woke me up whenever it went on. Otherwise, the room was good enough for a brief stay. Staff were friendly, but not always helpful. I thought the restaurant meals were fine. The property does offer wifi [ask for code at desk], but sometimes they are out of codes. There is a shuttle [limited hours] available if you want to go into town.","Date of stay: January 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Much Better than Expected","We had read some poor reviews about this hotel but were totally surprised when we got there.In total we spent three nights in Safari used the pool, bar and restaurant.We had two excellent and really large double rooms with en suite bath/Shower. The rooms were clean and had everything you might want including a fridge (not a minibar).Service was extremely friendly and efficient.The Restaurant staff were very friendly - especially to out two kids (13 and 10). Breakfast and evening buffet were excellent. Well presented and a good selection including local game in the evening.There had been reports that the hotel was loud, but this was certainly not the case. One can here the planes in the nearby eros airport but we did not find them loud enough to be disturbing - even though we live and are accustomed to quiet countryside.The little souvenir shop was adequate and the staff extremely helpful.The pool ,was spotless, but a little cold. We were almost alone in the afternoon and the kids loved it including the cake shop right next to the swimming area.The bar and staff were very pleasant, only nuisance were a couple of rather loud africans watching basketball on TV. They don't make cocktails, but they will get you a burger or french fries if you are feeling hungry. All in all very good.What more can one say: we would stay there again if we ever go to Windhoek again.","Date of stay: September 2011This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My first stay at Safari Hotel","My stay at Safari Hotel was only for the one night, I found the place easily was quite impressed with the look of the place and especially the reception area. Both check-in and check-out took a lot of time for every client. The little shop in reception helped me out with a cellphone sim-card so that was great. My long distance call to South Africa from the hotel room was charged at quite a high rate.","Date of stay: July 2009This review is the subjective opinion of an individual traveler and not of Tripadvisor LLC nor of its partners.
